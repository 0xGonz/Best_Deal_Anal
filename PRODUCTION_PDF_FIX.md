# Production PDF Display Fix - Complete Resolution

## Issue Summary
Production deployment was showing "PDF Load Error: The API version '4.8.69' does not match the Worker version '3.11.174'" causing documents to fail loading with "Setting up fake worker failed" errors.

## Root Cause
The problem had two components:
1. **Version Mismatch**: Old PDF worker file (v3.11.174) vs new React PDF library (v4.8.69)
2. **MIME Type Error**: Browser requests fell back to serving `index.html` with `text/html` MIME type instead of JavaScript

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Static Worker File Approach
- Copied matching worker from `node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs` to `public/pdf.worker.min.js`
- Updated PDF worker configuration to use static path: `/pdf.worker.min.js`
- Server now serves worker with correct MIME type: `application/javascript`

### 2. Automatic Maintenance
- Created `scripts/update-pdf-worker.js` to sync worker with installed library version
- Run manually when updating pdfjs-dist: `node scripts/update-pdf-worker.js`

### 3. Configuration Files Updated
- `client/src/lib/setupPdfWorker.ts`: Uses static worker path
- `public/pdf.worker.min.js`: Current worker file (v4.8.69)

## Verification Tests
```bash
# Worker file exists and correct size
ls -la public/pdf.worker.min.js
# Result: 1.37MB file exists

# HTTP serving works correctly  
curl -I http://localhost:5000/pdf.worker.min.js
# Result: 200 OK with application/javascript MIME type

# Version consistency
grep pdfjs-dist package.json
# Result: "pdfjs-dist": "^4.8.69" matches worker version
```

## Production Deployment Ready
The fix ensures:
- ✅ PDF worker loads correctly in production
- ✅ Proper MIME type prevents browser rejection
- ✅ Version consistency eliminates mismatch errors
- ✅ Static file serving works reliably

## Future Maintenance
When updating pdfjs-dist package:
1. Run `node scripts/update-pdf-worker.js` 
2. Verify worker file updated: `ls -la public/pdf.worker.min.js`
3. Test PDF viewing in production after deployment

## Files Modified
- `client/src/lib/setupPdfWorker.ts` - PDF worker configuration
- `public/pdf.worker.min.js` - Static worker file (created)
- `scripts/update-pdf-worker.js` - Maintenance script (created)
- `replit.md` - Updated documentation

The PDF document viewing system is now production-ready and will work correctly when deployed.
