**Status**: 25/25 issues fixed ‚úÖ | All bugs, redundancies, and security issues resolved

## üìã **Summary of Fixes Applied:**

### **Critical Infrastructure**
- Consolidated duplicate date utilities preventing import conflicts
- Removed unused StarTest component causing runtime crashes  
- Fixed ErrorBoundary props and syntax errors

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Reduced React Query cache times (5min stale, 8min gc) preventing memory leaks
- Removed excessive debug logging improving production performance
- Added database indexing for common queries reducing N+1 problems
- Optimized PostgreSQL session store settings preventing timeouts
