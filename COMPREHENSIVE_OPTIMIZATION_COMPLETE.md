The observability suite components are ready but require OpenTelemetry packages for full tracing:
```bash
npm install @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
```

### Environment Configuration
```env
# Observability (optional)
TELEMETRY_DISABLED=false  # Set to true to disable tracing
LOG_LEVEL=INFO           # DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
