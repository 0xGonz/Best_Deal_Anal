Why the DELETE call on /api/production/allocations/43 returns 409 Conflict
A 409 is the API’s deliberate “business rule violated” signal.
That endpoint will only hard-delete an allocation when all three of these conditions are simultaneously true — and allocation #43 is failing at least one of them:

Guard-rail	Where it is enforced	What it checks
(1) No capital-call rows	ProductionAllocationsService.delete() → throws AllocationHasCapitalCallsError → maps to HTTP 409	EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM capital_calls WHERE allocation_id = :allocationId) must be false.
(2) No payments recorded	Same service, second check	Same EXISTS test in table payments.
(3) Allocation status is still “committed” (i.e., $0 paid)	Service layer and a DB CHECK (paid_amount = 0); trigger will veto the delete	Protects the audit trail once even $1 has moved.

Because the log shows multiple 409s in a row and the allocation list refresh still contains id 43, the service is stopping the delete before any SQL DELETE is issued, not because of a permission problem.

How to confirm which guard-rail you hit
Run one quick set of queries (replace 43 if the ID changes):

sql
Copy
Edit
-- Capital–call dependency?
SELECT COUNT(*) AS calls
FROM   capital_calls
WHERE  allocation_id = 43;

-- Payment dependency?
SELECT COUNT(*) AS payments
FROM   payments
WHERE  allocation_id = 43;

-- Status snapshot
SELECT status, paid_amount
FROM   fund_allocations
WHERE  id = 43;
calls > 0 → You still have at least one call linked to the allocation.

payments > 0 → Someone has posted money; the allocation is now part of your immutable ledger.

paid_amount > 0 or status ≠ committed → Even if there are no open calls, the allocation is already partially/fully funded and cannot be removed.

Legitimate ways to remove or “undo” an allocation
Situation	Proper action	Why
Created by mistake and no capital calls/payments yet	Delete the capital-call drafts first, then retry DELETE /allocations/43.	Satisfies guard-rail #1.
Capital calls exist but were accidental	Cancel each call via DELETE /api/production/capital-calls/:id (returns 204).	Clears guard-rail #1.
Payments have already been logged	Cannot hard-delete. Instead, mark allocation as “cancelled” or “void” via the Archive button (soft-delete flag). All history stays intact for audit.	Ledger integrity requirement.
Allocation is partially or fully funded	Same: archive/void. If funds must be returned, create an “offsetting” journal (negative payment) rather than deleting history.	Ensures your capital-account trail stays GAAP-compliant.

(The UI exposes the Archive toggle by default; if you disabled it, re-enable in AllocationsTable.tsx.)

Take-away
The 409 you’re seeing is the system correctly protecting your ledger, not a bug.
Delete succeeds only when the allocation is still a clean, unreconciled stub. Otherwise, archive it or reverse it with proper journal entries—never hard-delete once capital has been called or paid.
