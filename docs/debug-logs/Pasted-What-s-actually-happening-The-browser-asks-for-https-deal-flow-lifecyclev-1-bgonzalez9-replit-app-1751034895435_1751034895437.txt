What‚Äôs actually happening

The browser asks for
https://deal-flow-lifecyclev-1-bgonzalez9.replit.app/assets/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.js

Your Express / Vite server can‚Äôt find that file, so it falls back to index.html.
index.html is served with the default header Content-Type: text/html.

The client tries to treat that HTML file as an ES-module worker script, but the MIME type
is wrong and the load fails, so React-PDF (or plain pdfjs) switches to ‚Äúfake worker‚Äù mode.
Fake worker also needs to import() the real script, so it dies immediately and you get the
‚ÄúSetting up fake worker failed‚Äù message.

You therefore have two separate problems:

‚ö†Ô∏è Problem	Why it happens	One-line fix
Missing file	Vite doesn‚Äôt copy pdf.worker.min.js into your /assets bundle because the import path you hard-coded never goes through the bundler.	Let Vite do the import for you (see snippet below) or manually place the worker file in client/public and reference it as /pdf.worker.min.js.
Wrong MIME type	When the fallback index.html is served, the header is text/html. Browsers refuse to execute that as JavaScript.	Once the path is correct, Vite will serve it with text/javascript automatically‚Äîbut you must stop the request from falling through to index.html first.

Two solid ways to solve it
1. Let Vite handle the worker (recommended)
ts
Copy
Edit
// viewer.tsx or App.tsx (before you render <Document>)
import { pdfjs } from 'react-pdf';
// üëá `?url` forces Vite to copy the file and give you a hashed URL
import workerSrc from 'pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.js?url';

pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = workerSrc;
Vite copies pdf.worker.min.js into /assets/<hash>.js at build time.

You never hard-code the path, so it works in dev and prod.

The server now finds the file, serves it with the proper MIME type, and the error disappears.

2. Host one static copy yourself
Move node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.js ‚Üí client/public/pdf.worker.min.js

Remove every other copy of the worker from the repo.

Point pdfjs at it once:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { pdfjs } from 'react-pdf';
pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = '/pdf.worker.min.js';
Make sure Express/Vite‚Äôs static-file middleware includes client/public (it already does
in most Vite templates).

Clean-up checklist (do these whichever approach you choose)
Delete duplicate workers in /client/src/assets/, /public/, etc.
Multiple <script> tags race to register workers and chew memory.

Remove the <script src="/assets/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.js"> tag from your
index.html; you no longer need to manually load it.

If you previously set limits.fileSize very low while debugging, bump it back up (PDFs

10 MB will still 413 otherwise).

After these steps, refresh the page in a private window (to avoid cached 404s) and watch the Network tab‚Äîyou should see the worker load with status 200 and MIME text/javascript, and your PDFs will render again.

Let me know once this part is stable and we‚Äôll tackle any remaining upload-pipeline quirks.
