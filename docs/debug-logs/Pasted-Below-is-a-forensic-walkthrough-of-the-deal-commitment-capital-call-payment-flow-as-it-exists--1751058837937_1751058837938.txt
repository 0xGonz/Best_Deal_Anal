Below is a forensic walkthrough of the deal → commitment → capital-call → payment flow as it exists in DealFlowLifecycle v1, the failure modes I uncovered, and a blueprint for hardening the workflow so “committed / partially-paid / funded” stays correct no matter how a deal drips capital.

1 | Where the design is solid
Data model – fund_allocations vs capital_calls is the right split: one row for the promise (commitment) and many rows for draws.

Enums – you already condensed allocation status to committed | partially_paid | funded and capital-call status to scheduled | called | paid | overdue | defaulted, which is exactly the minimal state machine you need.

Pure calculator – AllocationCalculator.calculate() gives a clean, side-effect-free way to derive totals – keep that.

Everything else that follows is about wiring these good pieces together.

2 | Critical break-points
Missing status synchronisation

AllocationStatusService.updateAllocationStatus() is an empty stub.

CapitalCallService.updateCapitalCall() assumes “lifecycle events” will propagate changes … but no event emitter/listener exists, so the allocation row is never refreshed when a call is paid.

Result: fund_allocations.paidAmount and status freeze at their first value; the UI shows “committed” forever even if payments land.

Payment validation stubbed out

PaymentWorkflowService calls AllocationStatusService.validatePayment(), but that method was never written.

A real payment post therefore throws a TypeError: AllocationStatusService.validatePayment is not a function and the whole request rolls back.

Capital calls never auto-create

CapitalCallService.createCapitalCallsForAllocation() is never invoked by the allocation layer. Commitments therefore have zero capital-call rows unless someone manually hits the POST endpoint. The front-end treats “no calls” as “nothing due”, so paid/unpaid math can never balance.

No constraint guaranteeing internal consistency

There is no CHECK on fund_allocations to enforce paidAmount ≤ amount. One fat-fingered payment can silently push an allocation beyond 100 % and the status calculator will misbehave.

Service sprawl

Nine different allocation-related services (allocation-core, domain, integrity, production-allocation, transaction-safe-allocation, …). Several are half-implemented; a few import the others recursively. This is the source of the “it worked yesterday, broke today” drift you’ve been fighting.

3 | Blueprint for a bullet-proof allocation lifecycle
Step	What to build	Why it fixes the bug
A	Single AllocationLifecycleService that owns every state change (createCommitment, scheduleCapitalCalls, recordPayment). Retire the eight legacy services.	Removes race conditions and duplicated logic.
B	Finish AllocationStatusService:
• implement validatePayment(allocation, amount) → rejects negatives/over-funding.
• implement updateAllocationStatus(allocationId) → (i) sum capital_calls.paidAmount; (ii) write fund_allocations.paidAmount; (iii) derive status via calculateStatus(). Call this from every payment or call update.	Guarantees the allocation row is ground truth.
C	In createAllocation immediately call scheduleCapitalCalls with user-provided cadence (single, quarterly, etc.). Emit a domain-event CapitalCallsCreated.	Ensures capital-call rows always exist, so UI and calculations have data.
D	Add a database CHECK on fund_allocations:
CHECK (paid_amount <= amount)	Stops over-payment corruption at the storage layer.
E	Introduce a Postgres view v_allocation_progress that exposes:
allocation_id, committed, called, paid, outstanding, uncalled, and an index on allocation_id. Point the dashboard directly at the view instead of re-hydrating in JavaScript.	All sums are computed once, in-db, with ACID guarantees—front-end just reads.
F	Put an integration-test harness (vitest or jest) that seeds a memory DB with one allocation, three capital calls (0 %, 50 %, 50 %), then posts two payments. Assert lifecycle outputs (status flips to partially_paid then funded, outstanding hits 0).	Locks the contract in place—future refactors can’t break the flow.

4 | Quick wins you can ship today
Wire up the stub – copy the validatePayment snippet below and drop it into AllocationStatusService.

ts
Copy
Edit
static validatePayment(a: FundAllocation, amt: number) {
  if (amt <= 0) return { isValid: false, error: 'Payment must be positive' };
  if ((a.paidAmount || 0) + amt > a.amount)
    return { isValid: false, error: 'Payment exceeds commitment' };
  return { isValid: true };
}
Trigger status refresh – at the end of PaymentWorkflowService.processPayment() call AllocationStatusService.updateAllocationStatus(allocationId).

UI clarity – expose uncalled = amount - SUM(called) and outstanding = SUM(called) - paidAmount right in the allocation card; color-code red if outstanding > 0 and the due date on the earliest unpaid capital call is passed.

5 | Long-term refactor sequence
Service consolidation (1–2 days) – fold overlapping services into AllocationLifecycleService.

Database constraints & views (½ day).

Event bus / domain events (1 day) – use p-event or a light wrapper around Node’s EventEmitter; fire CapitalCallPaid, AllocationStatusChanged.

Front-end hooks (1 day) – swap every status-derived calculation for a simple fetch of v_allocation_progress.

Test harness (1 day) – seed data, assert lifecycle.

Cleanup & docs (½ day).

Total: roughly one sprint to get from brittle to production-ready and white-label-safe.

6 | What this gives you when it’s done
A single source of truth for every dollar (committed, called, paid).

Automatic status flips—no manual patching in the DB console.

Real-time visibility for LPs: they can always see what’s still owed.

Confidence to white-label the platform—because the core accounting logic is now airtight and covered by tests.

Let me know if you’d like code snippets for the event bus or the test suite scaffolding; I can paste those next.
