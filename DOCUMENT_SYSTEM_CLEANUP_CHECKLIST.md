# Document System Cleanup Checklist

## âœ… COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Storage Consolidation
- [x] Moved all documents from scattered folders to unified `storage/documents/`
- [x] Created deal-specific subfolders: `storage/documents/deal-84/`
- [x] Created temp folder for processing: `storage/documents/temp/`
- [x] Updated document manager service to use unified storage location

### 2. File Organization
- [x] Consolidated documents from:
  - `/uploads/` â†’ `storage/documents/`
  - `/public/documents/` â†’ `storage/documents/`
  - `/public/uploads/` â†’ `storage/documents/`
  - `/data/uploads/` â†’ `storage/documents/`

### 3. Service Updates
- [x] Updated `DocumentManagerService` to use `storage/documents/` directory
- [x] Fixed file path references in upload and download methods
- [x] Updated storage statistics to use unified directory

## ðŸ”„ CURRENT STATUS

### Active Documents in System:
- **Deal 84 (High Road Partners)**: Term sheet PDF in `storage/documents/deal-84/`
- **Valor Equity Partners**: Financial statements in `storage/documents/temp/`
- **Sample documents**: Additional PDFs in `storage/documents/temp/`

### Database Schema:
- Documents table uses `snake_case` columns: `deal_id`, `file_name`, `file_path`
- File paths stored without leading slashes: `storage/documents/deal-84/filename.pdf`

## ðŸ“‹ NEXT STEPS

### High Priority:
1. Update database records to reflect new file paths
2. Test document upload/download functionality
3. Verify PDF viewer integration works with unified storage
4. Update document routes to use simplified service

### Medium Priority:
1. Implement document validation and integrity checks
2. Add automated cleanup for orphaned files
3. Create document migration utilities
4. Enhance error handling and logging

### System Architecture:
- **Storage**: Unified `storage/documents/` with deal-specific subfolders
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper foreign key relationships
- **Service**: Simplified document manager with clear separation of concerns
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for document operations

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DEBT RESOLVED
- Eliminated multiple storage locations
- Simplified file path management
- Reduced complexity in document service
- Improved maintainability and debugging

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [x] Single source of truth for document storage
- [x] Clear folder structure for deal organization
- [x] Simplified service architecture
- [ ] Full document workflow testing
- [ ] Database path synchronization
