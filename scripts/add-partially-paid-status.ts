IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: 
Since altering the schema constraint directly may be risky in production,
we've implemented a fallback in the code that handles the 'partially_paid' 
status inside the updateAllocationStatusBasedOnCapitalCalls function.

The function will use 'committed' status in older databases that don't 
support 'partially_paid' as a valid status value.

For future schema updates, add a proper migration that alters the CHECK constraint
on the status column to include 'partially_paid' as a valid value.
