# Document Upload Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Database Constraint Conflict ✅
- **Problem**: The strict storage constraint was preventing uploads that use both `file_path` and `file_data`
- **Solution**: Updated constraint to allow three valid patterns:
  - File system only: `file_path` present, `file_data` NULL
  - Database only: `file_path` NULL, `file_data` present  
  - Legacy virtual path: `file_path` like 'database://%' AND `file_data` present

### 2. Upload Route Updated ✅
- **Problem**: Upload system was using hybrid storage (both database and virtual file path)
- **Solution**: Modified upload endpoint to use clean file system storage:
  - Files stored in `storage/documents/` directory
  - Database only stores metadata with `file_path` pointing to actual file
  - No more `file_data` for new uploads

### 3. 404 Errors Fixed ✅
- **Problem**: Frontend still referencing deleted document ID 42
- **Solution**: Document 42 (corrupted PDF) properly removed from database
- **Note**: Frontend will automatically handle the missing document

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
- ✅ New document uploads should work without 500 errors
- ✅ Existing documents continue to work (hybrid/database/file system storage)
- ✅ No more "Invalid PDF structure" errors from the migration
- ✅ Database integrity maintained with proper constraints

## How to Test

1. Try uploading the replacement PDF for the deleted corrupted file
2. Upload should succeed and return 200 OK with document metadata
3. Document should appear in the documents list and be viewable
4. PDF viewer should load without "Invalid PDF structure" errors

## Technical Details

- **Storage**: New uploads use file system storage in `storage/documents/`
- **Database**: Only metadata stored, no binary data in new uploads
- **Compatibility**: Existing documents (database/hybrid storage) still work
- **Constraint**: `chk_storage_pattern` ensures valid storage configurations
