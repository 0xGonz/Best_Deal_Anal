### What’s happening
When you’re on the “New Deal” dialog you:

fill in name, sector …

drag a PDF (the pitch deck) into the Documents pane before the deal is actually persisted

hit Save Deal

On the network‑timeline the browser does this:

bash
Copy
Edit
(1) POST /api/deals        → returns 201 { id: 97 }
(2) POST /api/deals/undefined/documents   ❌ 404
Because the upload mutation fired before the deal id existed it used undefined (or sometimes an empty string) in the URL. The server rightly 404s; the React‑Query mutation throws; but the error is swallowed, so the UI looks fine until you reload and the deck is missing.

## Fix in two small steps

### 1 Defer document uploads until the deal row is created

tsx
Copy
Edit
// NewDealDialog.tsx  (simplified)

const [tempFiles, setTempFiles] = useState<File[]>([]);

const createDeal = useMutation(createDealApi, {
  onSuccess: async (deal) => {
    // now we have deal.id — upload any buffered docs
    await Promise.all(
      tempFiles.map((f) => uploadDocApi({ dealId: deal.id, file: f }))
    );
    queryClient.invalidateQueries(['documents', deal.id]);
    setTempFiles([]);      // clear buffer
  },
});

// sidebar drop handler
const onDrop = (file: File) => {
  if (createDeal.isLoading || !createDeal.data) {
    // deal not saved yet – buffer
    setTempFiles((prev) => [...prev, file]);
  } else {
    uploadDocApi({ dealId: createDeal.data.id, file });
  }
};
### 2 Server guard (optional but wise)

Inside POST /api/deals/:id/documents:

ts
Copy
Edit
const deal = await db.deals.findUnique({ where:{ id:+req.params.id } });
if (!deal) return res.status(404).json({ error:'dealNotFound' });
That turns the silent 404 into a clear JSON error so client logs reveal the issue.

## Quality‑of‑life improvements

Disable the upload drop‑zone until deal.id exists (show tooltip “Save deal first”).

If you want real‑time feedback, save the deal row immediately when the dialog opens (draft row) and patch it on Save. That way uploads always have a valid id.

Add a Playwright test: create deal → upload doc → reload → deck present.

### TL;DR
Buffer the files locally and upload them only after the deal POST succeeds, or create the deal row first. Once you add that tiny guard, every deck you attach while creating a deal will show up in the Documents tab after save and after reload.
