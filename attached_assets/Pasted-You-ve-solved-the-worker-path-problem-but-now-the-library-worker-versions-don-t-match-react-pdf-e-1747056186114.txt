You’ve solved the worker‑path problem, but now the library ↔ worker versions don’t match
react‑pdf embeds pdf.js core code in your main bundle.
That code reports its own version:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
API version 4.8.69          ← comes from react‑pdf’s internal pdf.js build
When the worker boots it sends back its version header:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Worker version 4.10.38      ← the file you imported with ?url
Because they’re different patch streams, pdf.js refuses to talk:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
UnknownErrorException: The API version "4.8.69" does not match the Worker version "4.10.38"
Fix in one sentence
Install the exact same pdfjs‑dist version that react‑pdf expects, and re‑import the worker from that package.

Step‑by‑step
Find the version react‑pdf wants

bash
Copy
Edit
pnpm list react-pdf pdfjs-dist
You’ll see something like:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
react-pdf 7.2.3
└─┬ pdfjs-dist 4.8.69   ← this is the copy bundled by react‑pdf
Pin pdfjs‑dist to that same number

bash
Copy
Edit
pnpm add pdfjs-dist@4.8.69
If you prefer being on the latest pdf.js (e.g. 4.10.x), upgrade both packages together:

bash
Copy
Edit
pnpm add react-pdf@7.3.1 pdfjs-dist@4.10.38
Verify package.json now contains the matching versions.

(Re)build your worker helper so it always pulls from the installed package, not a CDN or stray copy:

ts
Copy
Edit
// src/lib/setupPdfWorker.ts
import { pdfjs } from 'react-pdf';
import workerURL from 'pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.js?url';

pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = workerURL;
Restart dev server (pnpm dev) or rebuild prod (pnpm build && pnpm preview).

Open the PDF page.
DevTools console should now be silent—no version mismatch, no fake‑worker warning, PDF renders.

Lock it down to avoid repeat breakage
jsonc
Copy
Edit
// package.json
"dependencies": {
  "react-pdf": "7.2.3",
  "pdfjs-dist": "4.8.69"
},
"overrides": {               // or "resolutions" if you use Yarn
  "pdfjs-dist": "4.8.69"
}
This forces every transitive install to use the same patch stream.

In short
The worker is loading perfectly; just make sure pdf.js core and the worker file come from the same pdfjs‑dist version. Align the versions, rebuild, and the UnknownErrorException disappears. Let me know once it’s green—or if you’d rather bump to the newest 4.10.x line, I’ll walk you through upgrading both libs together and testing the build.
