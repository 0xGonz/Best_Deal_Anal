High‑Impact Fix List (ordered)
Add CI/CD
GitHub Actions: pnpm install, pnpm lint, pnpm test --coverage, then (optionally) deploy to Railway/Render.

Migrations Path Bug
Align drizzle.config.ts out: path with scripts/db-push.ts.

Session‑Store Hardening
Reject MemoryStore in production. Add cookie: { secure: true, sameSite: "lax" } and 24 h TTL.

Introduce ESLint + Prettier
Use @typescript-eslint/recommended + plugin:react/recommended; run on pre‑commit with Husky.

Break Up Mega‑Components
Slice any file >400 LoC: UI should be dumb presentational; data/logic in hooks (useFund, useDealTimeline, etc.).

Error Boundary Coverage
You already have a generic <ErrorBoundary/>; wrap every route‑level page.

Delete Duplicate Code
Consolidate ProtectedRoute.tsx; audit for other dupes.

Test Harness
Start with unit tests for utilities and routes (supertest). Snapshot‑test three critical UI components with Testing‑Library.

Add .env.example & README
List all required env vars: DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET, NEON_API_KEY, etc. Provide pnpm dev instructions.

Logging
Replace console.log with pino, use child‑loggers per module; redact passwords from logs automatically.

A monorepo (Nx, Turborepo, or npm workspaces) keeps client & server independent but shares schema.

5. Longer‑Term Improvements
Theme	Idea
Advanced Auth	Switch to Clerk or Auth.js for plug‑and‑play SSO, 2FA, magic links.
Data‑intensive views	Offload heavy analytics (industry distribution, leaderboards) to Postgres materialized views, refresh nightly.
File Storage	Your document endpoints serve raw binary from DB—use S3/Cloudflare R2 presigned URLs instead.
Feature Flags	Introduce Unleash or GrowthBook so you can ship incremental UI refactors safely.
Accessibility	Radix is mostly accessible, but custom Tailwind classes sometimes override focus rings—audit with Lighthouse.
