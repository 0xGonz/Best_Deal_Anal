Why the deck is blank now
You deleted document #11 (DELETE /api/documents/11 → 200 OK).

The UI still keeps that document selected in component state, so the viewer asks for

bash
Copy
Edit
GET /api/documents/11/download
which comes back 404, raising MissingPDFException.

React‑PDF swallows the exception and leaves an empty <canvas> → you see a white area.

Nothing in the Calendar module or its CSS is at fault this time—the PDF viewer is simply trying to show a file that no longer exists.

Fix it in three small patches
File	Patch	Purpose
client/src/hooks/useDeleteDocument.ts (or wherever you call the mutation)	```ts	
onSuccess: () => {		
queryClient.invalidateQueries(['documents', dealId]);		
setSelectedDocument(null); // NEW: clear stale selection		
},		

|
Copy
Edit
| **`DocumentsPanel.tsx`** | ```tsx
// Guard before rendering <DocumentViewer/>
if (!selectedDocument) {
  return <p className="text-gray-500">Select a document to preview</p>;
}
``` | Prevent the viewer from mounting when nothing is selected. |
| **`DocumentViewer.tsx`** | ```tsx
const { data: blob, isError } = useDocumentBlob(doc.id);

if (isError) {
  return <p className="text-red-500">Couldn’t load PDF (it may have been removed).</p>;
}
``` | User‑friendly message when a document goes missing. |

*(Names may differ—adapt to your folder structure.)*

## Optional UX polish

1. **Auto‑select the next document**  
   ```ts
   if (documents.length) {
     setSelectedDocument(documents[0]);
   }
inside a useEffect that runs after the query refreshes.

Disable the “Delete” button while its document is open, or pop a confirm dialog saying “After delete, the preview will close”.

Toast notifications on success/failure so users know what happened.

Sanity test
Open deal #83 and select the PDF.

Click Delete.

Expected:

Document list refreshes.

Preview pane shows “Select a document to preview” or auto‑loads the next file.

No XHR for /documents/11/download, no MissingPDFException.

If you upload a new deck and select it, the PDF should render exactly like before—fitting to width and responsive (the earlier CSS fixes still apply).

Recap
The white screen isn’t coming from the Calendar module; it’s a stale reference after you removed a file. Clear selectedDocument (or re‑select a valid one) when the list changes, and the viewer will behave again. Let me know once you patch—happy to review the exact code if you run into state‑management edge cases.
