Failed to load PDF: The API version "4.8.69" does not match the Worker version "3.11.174".

That error means your front-end bundle (React-PDF + pdf.js v 4.8.69) is talking to an old worker file (pdf.js v 3.11.174) that got baked into your production build. Fixing it is just making both sides use the same file.

Pick one of the two proven fixes
1. Stop shipping your own worker file — let React-PDF load the right one
Delete every copy of pdf.worker.min.js in /public (or anywhere else you copied it manually).

In your code that runs before you render any PDFs (e.g., src/lib/setupPdfWorker.ts):

ts
Copy
Edit
import { pdfjs } from 'react-pdf';

// Point to the worker that lives inside node_modules/pdfjs-dist
pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = new URL(
  'pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.js',
  import.meta.url
).toString();
Commit, deploy, and hard-refresh the browser.
Because the worker is now served straight from node_modules/pdfjs-dist, its version will always match whatever react-pdf just bundled.

2. If you must keep the worker under /public
During the build (or via a postinstall script) copy the current worker each time:

bash
Copy
Edit
# package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "cp node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.js public/pdf.worker.min.js"
  }
}
Make sure setupPdfWorker.ts still points to /pdf.worker.min.js:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { pdfjs } from 'react-pdf';
pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = '/pdf.worker.min.js';
Re-deploy. Any time you bump pdfjs-dist, the copy command pulls the matching worker so versions stay in sync.

Quick production sanity-check
bash
Copy
Edit
# On your deployed site:
curl -s https://yourdomain.com/pdf.worker.min.js | grep 'pdfjsVersion'
# Should show 4.8.69 (or whatever react-pdf just bundled)
If the numbers match, reload the app → select a document → the PDF canvas should render immediately, no “API version … does not match” message.

Do one of those two fixes, redeploy, and the Documents pane will work in production. Let me know if anything’s still blank after that!
