so hold onto that thouhgt but let me walk you thoruhg my wokrflow so you know what im lookinf for -- so when we make an invetsmnet most the times theirs a cpciatl call, now that capiatl call could be one time payment, it could be 4 times a year of $x it could be 20% of teh comiitmnet each year for 3 years --- truth be told we never know whihc one itll be so i need a system taht prepares for all --- with that being said the paid date should appear prooply in teh caldner and how much and what dela and what fund etc ---- ex: if we make an inevstment dec 30Th and 100% is called then it pays the 100% of the comitmnet inevstment --- now if they only call 10% up front then thats 100,000 paid and funded and 900,000 unfudned or otherise knonw as uncalled ---- this needs to workr flwakless liek.a cpiatla call and make sure it does and go thorihg my wokrflow and see what we can work one to make sure its all integarted --- like that paymnet shoudl appear on the date paid as a cpciatl call, not the day i input it in the system becasue im gogin abck and adding ievstmnets --- but on goging i need to be able to know and forceast how much liquiduty we'll need

Below is a workflow‑first re‑architecture that will let Capital Calls handle every pattern you meet in real life— single‑lump, quarterly draws, rolling 20 % tranches, or ad‑hoc calls years later—while giving you rock‑solid forecasting of how much cash the fund (and Doliver) will actually need on any date.

I break it into:

Data model upgrade – captures commitment → planned calls → cash movements without ambiguity.

Scheduling UX – one wizard that lets analysts express any call cadence in seconds.

Calendar & dashboard logic – due‑date vs paid‑date, status chips, and liquidity forecast.

Edge‑case handling – back‑filled historical calls, reallocations, over‑/under‑funding.

1 ► Data model (three tables, zero guesswork)
Table	Purpose	Key fields
commitments	Static promise per investment	id, fund_id, investment_id, committed_usd
capital_calls	Planned requests (you create these in advance or on announcement day)	id, commitment_id, due_date, call_pct, call_usd, status(scheduled/overdue/partially_paid/complete)
payments	Actual wires received (one call can be split into many payments)	id, capital_call_id, paid_date, amount_usd

Computed columns / views

uncalled_usd (commitment) = committed_usd - SUM(call_usd)

outstanding_usd (capital_call) = call_usd - SUM(payment.amount_usd)

These figures give you the liquidity gap at a glance.

2 ► Scheduling wizard (UI)
Select commitment (fund + investment auto‑filled).

Pick schedule mode:

“One‑time” → single row, call_pct=100.

“Equal installments” – grid: n × rows; enter first due‑date; auto monthly/quarterly/annual; % or $.

“Custom schedule” – spreadsheet grid with date+% or date+$ (sum must equal 100 % / commitment).

Preview timeline (inline bar: grey = uncalled, yellow = scheduled, green = received).

Save → bulk POST creates one or many capital_calls rows (all status='scheduled').

3 ► Calendar & dashboards
3.1 Rendering rules
Status	Card color	Shows
scheduled	amber	Investment – 20 % ($200k)
overdue	red	same + “⚠ Overdue”
partially_paid	indigo	badge “60 % paid”
complete	green	paid Mar 14

Cards live on due_date, never created_at.

3.2 Liquidity forecast widget

Edit
┌─────────┬────────────┬────────────┐
│ Date    │ Calls Due  │ Cumulative │
├─────────┼────────────┼────────────┤
│ 2025‑06‑30 │ $600 k     │ $600 k     │
│ 2025‑07‑15 │ $250 k     │ $850 k     │
│ 2025‑09‑30 │ $300 k     │ $1.15 M    │
└─────────┴────────────┴────────────┘
Pulls SUM(outstanding_usd) grouped by due_date ≥ today; feeds both table & area‑chart so Skip/Scott can eyeball liquidity needs fast.

4 ► Payment workflow
Mark paid action on any call opens a quick‑add form (amount, date, optional note).

Creates a payments row, recalculates outstanding_usd.

If outstanding hits 0 → call status='complete'; else partially_paid.

Dashboard “Capital called” bar updates in real‑time via React‑Query invalidate.

5 ► Edge‑cases covered
Scenario	How model handles it
Sponsor doubles the commitment mid‑life	Insert new commitment row or update committed_usd; wizard lets you add extra calls; dashboard recalculates uncalled.
GP pulls call forward	Edit due_date; calendar card moves automatically on next fetch.
LP wires late / partial	Add partial payment; outstanding_usd shows remainder; status toggles to partially_paid.
Back‑fill old deals	CSV import → create calls with status='complete' and matching payment rows in bulk.

6 ► Integration hooks
Notifications – webhook or Slack ping when a call flips to overdue or when a payment marks call complete.

Investor portal – API view joins commitment → capital_calls → payments to show each LP their capital account.

Treasury module – liquidity forecast table feeds weekly email to Ops (“We need $850 k by July 15”).

7 ► Implementation snippets
7.1 Server bulk create
ts
Copy
Edit
router.post('/commitments/:id/capital-calls/bulk', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  const { calls } = z.parse(req.body, callsSchema);  // [{dueDate, pct, usd}]
  const rows = calls.map(c => ({
    commitment_id: +req.params.id,
    due_date: c.dueDate,
    call_pct: c.pct,
    call_usd: c.usd,
    status: 'scheduled',
  }));
  await db.$transaction(rows.map(r => db.capital_calls.create({ data: r })));
  res.status(201).send();
});
7.2 Overdue view (no cron)
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE VIEW capital_calls_v AS
SELECT cc.*,
  CASE WHEN cc.status='scheduled' AND cc.due_date < CURRENT_DATE THEN 'overdue'
       ELSE cc.status END AS live_status,
  c.commitment_id, i.name AS investment_name, f.name AS fund_name
FROM capital_calls cc
JOIN commitments c ON cc.commitment_id = c.id
JOIN investments i ON c.investment_id = i.id
JOIN funds f       ON c.fund_id       = f.id;
8 ► Next steps for your repo
Add commitments and payments tables + migrate capital_calls (add status, paid_at).

Replace nightly cron with view for instantaneous overdue status.

Implement bulk wizard dialog and liquidity forecast widget.

Refactor existing calls API & calendar to consume the new view.

With this structure your system will handle any capital‑call pattern, show the correct payment date in the calendar, and give you the forward‑looking cash dashboard Skip keeps asking for—all integrated into the Deals / Funds flows you already have.
