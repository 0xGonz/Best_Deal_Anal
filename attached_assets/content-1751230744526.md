# Debugging Fund Allocation Status Tag Mismatch

**Problem:** In the Fund detail view’s allocations table, every deal’s **Status tag** is showing an incorrect label that doesn’t reflect the actual capital payment status. Deals that have had capital fully or partially called and paid are still labeled as “Committed” (or similarly wrong statuses), which is inconsistent with the underlying data (e.g. deals were marked _Invested_ and payments were made). This indicates a disconnect between the **status field** and the **actual payment progress**, leading to confusing or wrong tags.

## **Cause of the Disconnect**

The root cause is that the **allocation status** isn’t being updated properly when capital calls are issued and paid. In the system’s design, each fund allocation (deal commitment) has a status that should evolve based on payments:

- **`committed`** – no capital paid yet (initial state)

- **`partially_paid`** – some capital paid (partial fulfillment)

- **`funded`** – 100% of committed capital paid (fully funded)


These statuses are supposed to update automatically according to how much of the allocation’s committed amount has been paid[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/ALLOCATION_FUNDS_CAPITAL_CALLS_ANALYSIS.md). For example, if any payment has been made (but less than 100%), the status should become **“Partially Paid,”** and if payments reach 100% of the commitment, status should become **“Funded.”** Otherwise, it remains **“Committed.”**

However, this isn’t happening in the current system state. All deals remain labeled as **“Committed”** (or some default) despite payments being made. This mismatch can happen due to:

- **Missing/Broken Status Update Logic:** The backend logic that should sync allocation status with capital call payments wasn’t firing. Originally, the plan was to update the allocation’s status whenever a capital call is paid or partially paid (e.g. via a database trigger or service method). If that mechanism failed (for instance, an outdated trigger function referencing a non-existent column, as was the case with an `updated_at` field), the status field in the `fund_allocations` table never changed from “committed.” Thus the UI still shows the old status tag.

- **Partial vs. Partially Paid Enum Confusion:** There was a known issue where both `'partial'` and `'partially_paid'` were used as status labels in different places[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/attached_assets/Pasted-Deep-Clean-Code-Audit-Allocation-Capital-Call-and-Fund-Modules-Below-is-a-punch-list-that-surfac-1748958100213.txt). This dual-label bug meant some records might have an unexpected status value. For example, if an allocation status was set to a non-standard value like `'partial'` (instead of `'partially_paid'`), the front-end would not match it to the proper “Partially Paid” label/styling (since it only checks for `'partially_paid'`). This would either show a blank/gray tag or an incorrect capitalized string. The code audit recommended collapsing to the single canonical `'partially_paid'` value to avoid such mismatches[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/attached_assets/Pasted-Deep-Clean-Code-Audit-Allocation-Capital-Call-and-Fund-Modules-Below-is-a-punch-list-that-surfac-1748958100213.txt). If any allocations still had the old `'partial'` status, their tag would appear incorrect.

- **Stale Data Caching:** (Less likely in this scenario, but worth noting) The front-end uses React Query and even implements caching for some data (e.g. fund details and allocations lists may be cached for short periods)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/BUG_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md). If the allocation data was updated in the backend but the UI didn’t fetch the fresh data (due to caching or missing query invalidation), the tags might not reflect the latest status. The bug analysis did mention caching layers for performance[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/BUG_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md), but given that _all_ deals are showing wrong labels, it’s more likely a systematic update issue rather than a momentary caching delay.


In summary, the **disconnect comes from the allocation’s `status` field not being kept in sync with actual capital call payments**. The system expects a transition logic like:

> _If any portion paid ➔ status “Partially Paid”; if fully paid ➔ status “Funded”; if nothing paid ➔ “Committed.”_ [GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/ALLOCATION_FUNDS_CAPITAL_CALLS_ANALYSIS.md)

But due to the above issues, that logic wasn’t applied – leaving statuses stuck at “committed” (or an inconsistent value) for every deal, even when the data (paid amounts, deal stage, etc.) shows they should be updated.

## **Solution: Ensuring Status Matches the Data**

To fix this, we need to **synchronize the allocation status with the actual payment data** and enforce the correct labeling going forward. There are a few steps to achieve this:

1. **One-time Data Fix – Recalculate and Update All Allocation Statuses:**


First, correct the status of each existing fund allocation in the database based on its payment info. We can do this with a SQL update or script that sets the status according to the sum of paid capital calls for that allocation. For example, the intended logic can be implemented in SQL as in this snippet:


```whitespace-pre! sql


sql


Copy
UPDATE fund_allocations
SET
     paid_amount = COALESCE(capital_totals.total_paid, 0),
     status = CASE
       WHEN COALESCE(capital_totals.total_paid, 0) >= amount THEN 'funded'
       WHEN COALESCE(capital_totals.total_paid, 0) > 0 THEN 'partially_paid'
       ELSE 'committed'
     END
FROM (
     SELECT allocation_id,
            SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'paid' THEN paid_amount ELSE 0 END) as total_paid
     FROM capital_calls
     GROUP BY allocation_id
) as capital_totals
WHERE fund_allocations.id = capital_totals.allocation_id;

```


This query (similar to what was used in a repair script) recalculates each allocation’s total paid amount across all its capital calls and sets the status to **‘funded’** if total paid ≥ commitment, **‘partially\_paid’** if some paid but not all, or **‘committed’** if no payments[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/scripts/complete-allocation-status-fix.ts). Running such an update will immediately correct the labels in the UI to match reality (e.g. deals that had full payments will now show **“Funded”**, partial payments show **“Partially Paid,”** etc., with the proper color tags).

2. **Fix the Ongoing Sync Mechanism (Triggers/Backend Logic):**


After cleaning up the data, implement a robust way to keep it in sync whenever new capital calls or payments occur:
   - **Database Trigger Approach:** A reliable solution is to use a PostgreSQL trigger that fires on inserts/updates to the `capital_calls` table. This trigger would recompute the related allocation’s paid total and status each time a capital call is created or updated (or deleted). In fact, a corrected trigger function was drafted to do exactly this[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/scripts/complete-allocation-status-fix.ts). It updates the `fund_allocations` record by summing paid amounts of all calls for that allocation and assigning status = _funded / partially\_paid / committed_ based on the same logic as above. Make sure this trigger is created and enabled in the database. (The previous trigger, if any, should be replaced especially if it had errors – e.g., one known issue was a trigger trying to update a non-existent `updated_at` column, which would have prevented it from running.) The new trigger ensures **any future changes** (capital calls issued or payments made) automatically propagate to the allocation’s status field.

   - **Backup Service Logic:** If using triggers is not desirable alone, also update the backend service code to explicitly set allocation status in key workflows. For example, when marking a capital call as paid via the API, after updating the call’s status to “paid,” fetch the allocation’s total paid amount and update its status accordingly in the same transaction. This duplicates what the trigger does, but adds an extra layer of guarantee at the application level. The codebase already hints at this in places (setting status to 'funded' when all calls are paid[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/server/services/capital-call.service.ts)), but it should also handle partial payments. Ensuring the `AllocationStatusService.calculateStatus()` logic (shown above) is invoked after any payment activity will keep things consistent.
3. **Consolidate Status Enum Labels:**


Make sure only one label is used for the “partial payment” state. Based on the latest schema, **`partially_paid`** is the correct value. Any legacy use of `'partial'` should be migrated to `'partially_paid'` and the code should consistently check for `status === "partially_paid"`. This prevents the UI from missing the case. The code audit explicitly recommended collapsing dual labels into one and migrating old records[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/attached_assets/Pasted-Deep-Clean-Code-Audit-Allocation-Capital-Call-and-Fund-Modules-Below-is-a-punch-list-that-surfac-1748958100213.txt) – implement this if not already done. After migration, you can even enforce this at the database level by updating the ENUM type to remove the obsolete label, so no future inconsistency occurs.

4. **Verify Front-End Displays:**


With the backend fixed, the front-end should automatically show the right tags, since it just renders whatever `allocation.status` it receives. The Fund detail page already formats the status names (capitalizing and spacing “Partially Paid” correctly)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/client/src/pages/FundDetail.tsx). Once the data is correct, you should see:


   - **Funded** – for fully paid deals (green badge)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/client/src/pages/FundDetail.tsx)

   - **Partially Paid** – for partially paid deals (purple badge)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/client/src/pages/FundDetail.tsx)

   - **Committed** – for deals not paid yet (blue badge)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/client/src/pages/FundDetail.tsx)

   - **Unfunded** – (if used for called-but-no-payment scenarios, amber badge) – ensure the logic for when to use this is clear, or consider dropping it if not needed, as the state machine might treat no payment as just “Committed”.


Also double-check that on the Deals page (pipeline), the **deal stage** vs. fund status aren’t being confused. The Deals list shows pipeline stages (Invested, Closed, etc.), whereas the Fund’s table shows capital status. They serve different purposes, but after fixes they should at least not conflict in meaning. For example, a deal in stage “Invested” can show as “Partially Paid” in the fund view if not all capital is in – that’s okay as long as it’s accurate. The key is that the **Status tags in the fund’s allocation table must accurately reflect payment progress**, which the above fixes ensure.

5. **Test the Full Cycle:**


After applying these fixes, run through a full allocation lifecycle to verify the tags update in real time:
   - Create a new allocation (it should start as **Committed**).

   - Issue a capital call and mark it partially paid (the allocation’s status should turn **Partially Paid** immediately).

   - Complete all calls/payments (status should change to **Funded**).

   - If a call is issued but nothing is paid by its due date, decide if you label the allocation as “Unfunded” or leave as committed – ensure consistency in the logic for that edge case. (If using **`unfunded`** as a distinct status, you’d need to set it when a call is outstanding past due; otherwise you might skip it. Currently, the code treats no payment as still committed by default[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/ALLOCATION_FUNDS_CAPITAL_CALLS_ANALYSIS.md), unless explicitly marked written off or similar.)

   - Confirm the UI badges and fund metrics (called/uncalled capital figures) all line up with the scenario. The fund’s **Called Capital** number should equal the sum of paid amounts for “Partially Paid” and “Funded” deals, and **Uncalled** should correspond to what’s left in “Committed” ones[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/ALLOCATION_FUNDS_CAPITAL_CALLS_ANALYSIS.md)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/ALLOCATION_FUNDS_CAPITAL_CALLS_ANALYSIS.md). Any discrepancy means something is still out of sync.

By implementing the above, we restore the “extremely modular and declarable” approach as intended – the status tags become purely data-driven and accurate. In short, **fix the status computation at the source** so that the labels the UI displays (which are directly tied to the allocation’s `status` field) always match the reality of capital calls and payments. Once the allocation statuses update correctly (either via trigger or service logic) on every capital call event, the disconnect will be resolved and the fund’s table will display the correct status tags for each deal, in sync with the underlying data[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/scripts/complete-allocation-status-fix.ts)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/a58e02ce7873f57d1fca9916c6626a3f5b7425cc/client/src/pages/FundDetail.tsx).
