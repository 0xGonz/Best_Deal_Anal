The fundamental problem is that your server on Replit is not successfully serving the pdf.worker.mjs (or pdf.worker.min.js) file when requested by the browser at the specific URL the PDF library is trying to load it from. This is causing a 404 error, and your server is likely returning an HTML page for that 404 route instead of the intended JavaScript file.

To fix this:

Verify the Worker File's Location: Ensure that the pdf.worker.mjs (or pdf.worker.min.js, depending on which version your react-pdf/PDF.js setup expects or provides) is actually located in your application's publicly accessible directory on Replit at the path your application is trying to fetch it from (e.g., /pdfjs/).

Set workerSrc Correctly: You must tell the PDF library the correct public URL to load the worker from. Based on the preload warning, it looks like you might intend to serve it from /pdfjs/.

In your application code (where you initialize or use react-pdf), add this line, adjusting the path and filename (.mjs or .min.js) to match the actual file you've placed in your public directory:

JavaScript

import { pdfjs } from 'react-pdf';

// Set the worker source to the *public URL* where the file is hosted
// Replace '/pdfjs/pdf.worker.min.js' with the actual public path to your worker file
pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = `/pdfjs/pdf.worker.min.js`;
// Or if the file is named pdf.worker.mjs:
// pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = `/pdfjs/pdf.worker.mjs`;
Check Server Configuration (Replit): In a standard web server setup or a build process that generates a public or dist folder, files placed in that folder are automatically served statically. Ensure your Replit setup correctly serves static files from your public directory. If you're using a specific framework or build tool, consult its documentation on serving static assets. Sometimes, a build step is required to copy the worker file into the correct output directory.

In short: The error is a 404 when trying to load the worker script, causing the server to return HTML instead of JavaScript. You need to make sure the worker file is in your publicly accessible folder on Replit and configure react-pdf to load it from the correct public URL using pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc.
