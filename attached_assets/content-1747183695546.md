# Investment Allocation Lifecycle Walkthrough

## Deal Allocation to a Fund

When a deal is allocated to a fund, the front end (e.g. **AllocateFundModal.tsx** in `client/src/components/deals`) gathers the allocation form data (fund, amount, dates, schedule). It calls the backend **POST `/api/allocations`** (see _server/routes/allocations.ts_) to create the allocation record. The server validates via `insertFundAllocationSchema` and inserts into the **`fund_allocations`** table (fields include fundId, dealId, amount, amountType, allocationDate, status, etc.). If the user selected a multi-call schedule, the controller then invokes `capitalCallService.createCapitalCallsForAllocation(...)` (in **capital-call.service.ts**). This service computes each capital call’s **callDate, dueDate, amount, and status** (scheduled by default) and inserts rows into the **`capital_calls`** table (columns include allocationId, callAmount, amountType, callDate, dueDate, outstanding, status, etc.). For a “single” schedule, a paid call is created immediately with status = `paid`; otherwise multiple calls are split by frequency and percentage into scheduled amounts.

On success, the backend returns the new allocation. The front end invalidates relevant React Query caches ( `/api/allocations`, `/api/deals`, `/api/funds`, etc.) to refresh data (see **AllocateFundModal.tsx**, lines 184–193). Fund and deal pages (e.g. **FundDetail.tsx** and **DealDetail.tsx**) then display the updated allocation list and portfolio weights. (Note: after inserting, the backend should also call a weight-recalculation helper, but the current flow only updates weights on GET or via an explicit function.)

## Capital Call Scheduling and Database Flow

The service **createCapitalCallsForAllocation** (in _capital-call.service.ts_) handles creating 1 or multiple calls for the allocation. It normalizes dates (to noon UTC) to avoid timezone drift, splits the total allocation amount by the schedule, and creates each **capital call** record in one transaction. The capital-call records include a calculated **`outstanding`** amount (initially equal to the call amount). If percentages were used, the service converts them into dollar amounts and finalizes `callPct` to ensure total =100%.

The **database tables** involved in this flow are:

- **`fund_allocations`** – holds each allocation (commitment) with fields like `amount`, `status` ( `committed`/ `funded`/etc.), `portfolioWeight`, and returns (moic, irr). See _shared/schema.ts_: fund\_allocations columns \[amount, amountType, status, etc.\].

- **`capital_calls`** – one row per call event, with fields like `allocation_id` (FK to allocation), `call_amount`, `amount_type`, `call_date`, `due_date`, `paid_amount`, `paid_date`, `outstanding_amount`, `status` (scheduled, called, partial, paid, etc.), and `call_pct`. (Schema excerpt: see \[insertCapitalCallSchema\] in code.)

- **`capital_call_payments`** – each payment against a call, with `capital_call_id` FK, `payment_amount`, `payment_date`, etc.


When calls are created on allocation, a **timeline event** is recorded (e.g. “Created X capital calls for allocation”) via `storage.createTimelineEvent` (in the allocation route at line 250).

## Frontend Pages and Components

- **Deal Detail Page** – Under the “Allocations” tab, it lists all fund allocations for that deal. It includes the **`AllocationCommitmentInfo`** widget (in _components/allocations/AllocationCommitmentInfo.tsx_) which fetches commitment stats ( `GET /api/commitments/allocation/:id/stats`) to display “Called” vs. “Uncalled” capital for the allocation. It also has a button to open **AllocateFundModal** to create new allocations.

- **Fund Detail Page** – Shows a table of deals allocated to that fund ( `GET /api/allocations/fund/:fundId`). Each row has actions: **View Capital Calls** (link to `/capital-calls/allocation/{allocationId}`), **Create Capital Call** (navigates to the deal’s Capital Calls tab with `createFor={allocationId}`), and toggles for marking “Funded/Unfunded” status. The Create/Mark actions trigger API calls (e.g. calling `PATCH /api/allocations/:id` to set status). The Create Capital Call form is handled by **CreateCapitalCallForm.tsx** (or **CapitalCallForm.tsx** on the calendar) which submits to `POST /api/capital-calls` with fields like allocationId, callAmount, amountType, dueDate.

- **Capital Calls By Allocation Page** – This page ( **CapitalCallsByAllocation.tsx**) takes an `allocationId` from the route. It queries **GET `/api/allocations/{id}`** for allocation info and **GET `/api/capital-calls/allocation/{id}`** for all calls on that allocation. It renders a sorted list of calls, showing call date, due date, amount, status, and offers edit or delete. Users can add a new call via a modal ( **CreateCapitalCallForm** embedded here) or add payments to calls (using **CapitalCallPaymentForm.tsx**). The mutations use `/api/capital-calls` endpoints. On success, the page invalidates queries and refreshes.

- **Capital Calls Dashboard / Calendar Page** – The **Calendar.tsx** page shows all capital call events on a calendar. It uses a custom hook **useCalendarEvents** to fetch **all capital calls** ( `GET /api/capital-calls`) and closing events. The hook then highlights days with call due dates (“due”), call dates (“call”), and payment dates (“paid”). Users can click a date to open a **CapitalCallForm** to create or edit a call. The **CapitalCallForm.tsx** (in components/calendar) lets the user pick a deal, an allocation from that deal, enter amount/percentage and due date, and posts to `POST /api/capital-calls`. It refreshes the calendar on success by invalidating the `/api/capital-calls` query.

- **Payment Tracking Components** – When adding a payment, the form **CapitalCallPaymentForm.tsx** submits to **POST `/api/capital-calls/{callId}/payments`**. The backend route ( `routes/capital-calls.ts` line 517) calls `capitalCallService.addPaymentToCapitalCall(...)`. This service checks for overpayment, inserts a row in **capital\_call\_payments**, updates the call’s `paid_amount` and `outstanding`, and sets call status to “partial” or “paid” accordingly. The updated call (with its payments list) is returned to the client. After adding a payment, the backend also logs a timeline event (Deal-level) noting the payment. The frontend then shows updated paid amounts and call status.


## Called vs Uncalled Capital Tracking

The system tracks “called” vs “uncalled” capital via a **commitment stats API**. The backend route **GET `/api/commitments/allocation/:id/stats`** (in _routes/commitments.ts_) calls `commitmentsService.getCommitmentStats(allocationId)`. This computes:

- _totalCommitment_ (the allocation amount)

- _calledAmount_ (sum of all calls’ amounts)

- _paidAmount_ (sum of all payments)

- _outstandingAmount_ (called – paid)

- _uncalledAmount_ (commitment – called)


and percentages of each relative to commitment. The front end (AllocationCommitmentInfo) displays these as “Called Capital” and “Uncalled Capital” and uses a progress bar to show proportions. The stats update whenever calls or payments change (the client invalidates the stats query on allocations/calls mutations).


## Backend Routes and Services Summary

- **Allocations Routes (server/routes/allocations.ts):**
  - `POST /api/allocations` – create allocation (validates and inserts allocation, then calls service to schedule calls).

  - `GET /api/allocations/fund/:fundId` – list allocations for a fund (and recalc portfolio weights).

  - `GET /api/allocations/deal/:dealId` – list allocations for a deal.

  - `PATCH /api/allocations/:id` – update allocation (e.g. to mark as funded/unfunded).

  - `PATCH /api/allocations/:id/date` – update allocation date.

  - `DELETE /api/allocations/:id` – delete allocation (and cascades calls/payments).
- **Capital Calls Routes (server/routes/capital-calls.ts):**
  - `GET /api/capital-calls` – all calls (used by calendar).

  - `GET /api/capital-calls/allocation/:allocationId` – calls for an allocation.

  - `GET /api/capital-calls/deal/:dealId` – calls for a deal (join lookup).

  - `POST /api/capital-calls` – create a call (calls `storage.createCapitalCall`).

  - `PATCH /api/capital-calls/:id/status` – update status/paid amount.

  - `PATCH /api/capital-calls/:id/dates` – update call & due dates.

  - `PATCH /api/capital-calls/:id` – generic update (redirects to status/dates if present).

  - `DELETE /api/capital-calls/:id` – delete call (cascade payments).

  - `GET /api/capital-calls/:id/payments` – list payments for call.

  - `POST /api/capital-calls/:id/payments` – add a payment (updates call status via service).

  - `GET /api/capital-calls/payments/:paymentId` – get single payment record.
- **Commitments Routes (server/routes/commitments.ts):**
  - `GET /api/commitments/allocation/:id/stats` – return commitment stats for UI.

  - (Deprecated) `POST /api/commitments/allocation/:id/calls` – bulk create calls (legacy).
- **Services and Storage:**
  - **Storage (database-storage.ts)** uses Drizzle ORM to query/insert into `fund_allocations`, `capital_calls`, `capital_call_payments`, etc. Key methods: `createFundAllocation`, `createCapitalCall`, `createCapitalCallPayment`, `getCapitalCallsByAllocation`, `updateCapitalCallStatus`, `updateCapitalCall`, `updateFundAllocation` (to set status or weight), etc.

  - **CapitalCallService** (in _capital-call.service.ts_) – contains business logic for scheduling calls ( `createCapitalCallsForAllocation`) and adding payments ( `addPaymentToCapitalCall`). It ensures no overpayment, calculates new outstanding and status, and inserts payment records.

  - **CommitmentsService** (in _commitments.service.ts_) – has `getCommitmentStats(allocationId)` which computes the called/paid/uncalled totals for an allocation. (Also has fund-level stats aggregator, not detailed here.)

## Key Findings and Recommendations

- **Allocation Status Logic Flaw:** The current backend logic for updating an allocation’s status (in `updateAllocationStatusBasedOnCapitalCalls`) only sets an allocation to **"funded"** if _all_ called capital has been paid; otherwise it leaves it "committed". The "partial" status is never used. This means a partially paid allocation still appears as “committed.” _Recommendation:_ Set allocation status to `"partial"` when 0 < paidAmount < calledAmount, and only mark `"funded"` when fully paid. Ensure this update is called after any payment insertion (e.g. in `addPaymentToCapitalCall` or via a trigger).

- **Manual Status Overrides and Race Conditions:** The UI allows manually marking allocations as funded/unfunded in FundDetail. These actions call `PATCH /api/allocations/:id`. However, allocation status can also change via capital call activity. There is no clear synchronization: if a user manually marks funded but then deletes a call, status may become stale. _Recommendation:_ Centralize status updates in one place. For example, always use the derived method (from capital calls) and disable manual overrides, or add guards to keep them consistent.

- **Duplication of Capital Call Logic:** The codebase contains two patterns for handling calls. There’s the new service-based flow (e.g. **capitalCallService** and routes in `server/routes/capital-calls.ts`), but also older controller code ( `CapitalCallController` in _controllers/capital-call.controller.ts_ and routes/new-capital-calls.ts) which appears unused. This leads to confusion and potential divergence in behavior. _Recommendation:_ Remove or refactor out the deprecated **new-**\\* files and ensure only one unified capital-call API/service is used.

- **Frontend Query Key Mismatch:** Many React Query hooks use an array key (e.g. `queryKey: ['/api/allocations', allocationId]`) but the global query function only uses `queryKey[0]` as the URL. This likely causes requests to miss the `allocationId` parameter. In practice, developers may have had to interpolate `allocationId` into the string manually. _Recommendation:_ Standardize query keys to include the full URL string (e.g. `\`/api/allocations/${allocationId}\` `) or adjust ` queryFn\` to handle parameters.

- **Calendar Event Discrepancies:** The calendar highlights “due”, “call”, and “paid” days by inspecting all calls. However, the hook fetches **all** capital calls and closing events, filtering by the active tab. Large funds with many calls may cause performance issues. Also, the calendar form ( **CapitalCallForm.tsx**) only allows picking an existing deal/allocation; it does not show partial commitments. Consider adding event colors for partial vs paid. _Recommendation:_ For UX, consider lazy-loading events or separating call vs closing event feeds. Also, the creation form currently requires an allocation; it might be helpful to allow scheduling a first call from the deal level if no allocation exists (or prompt to allocate first).

- **Validation and Edge Cases:**
  - The service prevents over-paying a call, but does not prevent creating overlapping or duplicate calls. It could check that the sum of scheduled call amounts does not exceed the allocation. (There is some code in _CommitmentsService_ hinting at checking total call <= commitment, but it's unclear if used.) _Recommendation:_ Validate total schedule percentages ≤100% and total dollar calls ≤ commitment.

  - Partial call amounts (if `amountType='percentage'`) are converted on the fly. Rounding issues could leave 1–2 cents unallocated. Ensure the last call “soaks up” rounding differences (as is done) and persist a `callPct` for reference.

  - Calendar date normalization should be consistent. The code uses a `normalizeToNoonUTC` utility to avoid timezone shifts. Confirm that all date inputs/outputs go through this (both create and edit forms).
- **UI/UX Improvements:**
  - **Allocation View:** Show number of scheduled calls and next due date directly in the allocation list (FundDetail or DealDetail), so users see upcoming calls without clicking through.

  - **Capital Calls Listing:** On the CapitalCallsByAllocation page, highlight calls that are overdue (dueDate in past and not fully paid). Add filters by status (e.g. show only overdue calls).

  - **Partial Payments:** In the payment history (CapitalCallPaymentHistory.tsx), indicate if a call is now partial vs paid. The backend sets status, but the UI could color-code “partial” calls.

  - **Progressive Enhancement:** After adding a payment, automatically update the allocation’s called/uncalled stat UI (e.g. by invalidating the commitments query). It looks like the code creates a timeline entry and returns the payment, but doesn’t explicitly refresh allocation stats. Ensure the front end invalidates `/api/commitments/allocation` after a payment.
- **Modularization and Code Reuse:**
  - Common hooks (e.g. for fetching allocations or capital calls) could be abstracted. For example, a `useAllocations(fundId)` hook, or a `useCapitalCalls` hook that takes an optional filter.

  - Shared UI components (DatePicker, CurrencyInput) are used in multiple forms; ensure they behave consistently.

  - There is some logic in services that might be shared (e.g. status determination). Consider moving the allocation-status logic out of the allocations route into the service layer (e.g. `capitalCallService` or `commitmentsService`) so all updates (new call, payment, status patch) reuse the same logic path.
- **New Features / LP Visibility:**
  - To add **dynamic call forecasts**, one could extend the schedule form to allow editing all future call dates and amounts (not just the first call date). Then the calendar or fund view could project a schedule chart. This likely requires a specialized UI or Excel-like schedule editor.

  - For **LP (Limited Partner) visibility**, the system could implement a read-only portal or an exported PDF/report that shows each LP’s commitment, contributions (calls), distributions, and portfolio metrics. Currently, data is only visible to admins/staff. This would involve adding LB (lowercase?), similar to documents or notifications.

In summary, the DealFlowLifecyclev1 code correctly implements the basic lifecycle—allocating deals to funds, scheduling capital calls, and tracking payments—but has some bugs and organizational issues. Addressing the allocation-status logic, cleaning up duplicate routes, and enhancing the UI for clarity will improve reliability. Modularizing shared logic in services and using consistent query patterns on the front end will make the system easier to maintain and extend (for example, to support forecasting or LP dashboards).
