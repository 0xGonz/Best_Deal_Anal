Functional Requirements3.1 Deal IntakeThis is the gateway for all potential investments, requiring efficient and accurate data capture, including sector classification.Email Ingestion:Analysis: This feature requires a dedicated email service and sophisticated parsing logic. The system must handle various email formats, extract structured data (sender email, subject), and identify and process attachments reliably. Error handling for parsing failures and spam filtering are critical. The auto-tagging with date received and default stage ensures a consistent starting point for all ingested deals. While sector classification from email is challenging, the system should flag deals for mandatory sector assignment post-ingestion.Technical Considerations: Requires integration with email protocols (IMAP/POP3 or cloud-specific APIs), robust text parsing libraries, and secure attachment handling/storage. Requires a mechanism to prompt users for sector classification after automatic ingestion.Manual & Bulk Add:Analysis: Provides flexibility for deals sourced outside of email or for initial data migration. The quick-add modal prioritizes speed for initial entry, while CSV/XLS import caters to larger datasets from conferences or third-party platforms. Data validation during manual and bulk entry is essential to maintain data quality. Sector must be a required field during manual entry and a mandatory column/mapping during bulk import.Technical Considerations: Requires user-friendly form design with input validation and a robust data import module capable of handling different file formats and mapping columns. Sector field must use a predefined list managed by Admins.CRUD & Metadata:Analysis: The core data structure for tracking deals. The defined fields capture essential information throughout the lifecycle. Sector is a primary metadata field that must be accurately captured and easily editable. The ability to add custom tags/categories provides flexibility for internal classification and reporting, complementing the primary sector classification. Implementing robust data validation rules is crucial to ensure data consistency and reliability for downstream processes like performance calculations and AI analysis.Technical Considerations: Requires a well-designed database schema with a dedicated field for Sector (likely a foreign key to a Sector lookup table) and a flexible UI for editing deal details.Pipeline View:Analysis: The central hub for managing deal flow. A well-designed pipeline view provides immediate visibility into the volume and status of deals at each stage. Crucially, the pipeline view must include prominent display of the deal's sector. Filtering and sorting capabilities are essential for users to quickly find relevant deals. Filtering and grouping by sector must be a primary function. Visual indicators (e.g., color-coding by stage or status) enhance scannability. Consider visualizations (e.g., bar charts) showing the distribution of deals across sectors in the pipeline.Technical Considerations: Requires efficient database querying and a responsive front-end component capable of displaying and manipulating large datasets. Requires robust filtering and grouping logic based on the Sector field.3.2 Pipeline & WorkflowThe defined workflow stages represent the critical steps in Doliver's investment process. The transitions between stages are "gates" that require specific actions and artifacts, ensuring a standardized and auditable process.Analysis: Each stage transition should be explicitly triggered by a user action (e.g., "Mark as Screening Complete"). The requirement for specific artifacts at each gate ensures that necessary documentation is completed before moving forward. Automated notifications via Slack/Teams and email are vital for keeping the team informed and driving action. Auto-timestamping the Deal Timeline provides an immutable record of process progression, crucial for compliance and post-mortem analysis. While sector doesn't directly gate transitions, understanding the sector context is implicit in the evaluation at each stage.Technical Considerations: Requires implementing state machine logic for deal stages, integration with notification APIs (Slack, Teams, Email), and ensuring atomic updates to the Deal record and Timeline.3.3 Deal Timeline & NotesProvides the historical context and collaborative workspace for each deal.Analysis: The vertical timeline offers a chronological view of all significant events related to a deal, creating a comprehensive audit trail. Markdown/RTF notes with @mentions facilitate rich, collaborative discussions and documentation. Global search across notes and attachments is a critical feature for knowledge retrieval and due diligence. Sector context should be visible when viewing the timeline and notes for a deal.Technical Considerations: Requires a dedicated data model for timeline events, a rich text editor with mention functionality, and a robust search index (e.g., Elasticsearch) for efficient full-text search across notes and document content.3.4 Leaderboard & Investment ThesesA mechanism for collaborative evaluation and ranking of deals by the investment team.Analysis: The "starring" mechanism allows users to signal interest, while the structured Mini-Memo ensures a consistent framework for evaluating key aspects of a deal. The Mini-Memo structure must include a specific section or field for "Sector Fit" or "Sector Analysis" to encourage explicit consideration of the deal within its industry context. The weighted scoring based on user roles introduces a hierarchy to the ranking, reflecting the influence of different team members. Real-time reactivity of the leaderboard encourages engagement and provides immediate feedback on deal perception. Consider allowing users to filter leaderboards by sector.Technical Considerations: Requires a data model to capture user stars, Mini-Memos (with a dedicated field for sector analysis), and role weights. The leaderboard table requires dynamic calculation and sorting based on weighted scores. Real-time updates may require websockets or similar technologies.3.5 AI Analyst ModuleLeveraging AI to provide an objective perspective and synthesize team insights, incorporating sector context.Analysis: This module adds significant analytical value by aggregating diverse opinions, identifying potential inconsistencies, and generating a concise summary. The AI should be specifically prompted to consider the deal's sector and analyze the Mini-Memos within that context. Detecting contradictory assumptions related to sector trends or market dynamics is a powerful feature. The AI Summary Memo should explicitly include an assessment of the deal's sector attractiveness and fit.Technical Considerations: Requires integration with a Large Language Model (LLM) API. The system needs to preprocess Mini-Memos, structure the prompt for the LLM (including the deal's sector), and parse the LLM's response. Careful consideration of data privacy and security is needed, especially if using external LLMs. The output needs to be stored and associated with the Deal record.3.6 Fund Allocation & Post-Close TrackingManaging investments once capital has been deployed and monitoring their performance over time, with sector-level insights.Analysis: The Fund Catalogue provides structure for organizing investments, often defined by strategy which may include sector focus. The one-click allocation simplifies the process of moving a deal from the pipeline to an invested state, capturing essential details like amount and security type. The performance dashboards are critical for understanding the health of the portfolio at both the fund and individual deal levels. Performance dashboards must include the ability to filter and view metrics (IRR, MOIC, distributions, etc.) broken down by sector. This allows for sector-specific performance attribution and analysis. The waterfall visual provides a clear picture of capital movement. LP Views are essential for transparent reporting to limited partners, requiring strict permissioning. LP views should also include sector breakdown of their portfolio.Technical Considerations: Requires a data model for Funds, Investments, Distributions, and Valuations. Implementing accurate IRR and MOIC calculations requires careful handling of cash flows and valuations. Dashboard visualizations require integration with charting libraries. Data aggregation and calculation logic must support filtering and grouping by Sector. Robust permissioning is needed for LP views, including sector-level data access.3.7 Reporting & ExportsProviding necessary data outputs for internal review, external reporting, and integration with other systems, including sector data.Analysis: Standardized reports (like the Quarterly PDF pack) streamline reporting processes. Reports must include sector breakdowns of pipeline activity and portfolio performance. Excel exports provide flexibility for further analysis in external tools. Exports must include the Sector field for all relevant data. API endpoints are crucial for integrating the application with Doliver's broader technology ecosystem (e.g., BI tools, accounting software). APIs must expose sector data and allow for sector-based filtering.Technical Considerations: Requires report generation capabilities (e.g., PDF libraries), data export modules, and developing and maintaining secure and well-documented REST/GraphQL APIs that support sector data.4. Non-Functional RequirementsThese requirements define the quality attributes and constraints of the system, critical for its reliability, security, and usability.Security: MFA, row-level access by role & fund; SOC-2 ready. Permissioning should also consider access to sector-specific data if required.Email Parser Accuracy: High accuracy is essential to minimize manual correction of ingested deals.Scalability: The system must perform well even with a large volume of data and users, requiring careful database design, caching strategies, and potentially microservices. Database indexing and query optimization must consider Sector as a frequently used filter.Uptime: High availability is necessary to ensure the application is accessible when needed for critical investment activities.Audit Trail: An immutable log is non-negotiable for compliance and accountability, tracking every change made to deal data and by whom. Changes to the Sector field must be included in the audit trail.Integrations: Seamless integration with existing tools (email, communication platforms, SSO, e-signature, accounting) is vital for workflow efficiency and data flow.Compliance: Meeting SEC (RIA) record retention requirements dictates specific data archiving and retrieval capabilities. Archived data must retain sector classification.5. Data Model (Logical)The proposed data model outlines the key entities and their relationships, forming the backbone of the application's data storage.Sector: A lookup table with predefined sector classifications (managed by Admin).Deal ←1-to-M→ TimelineEvent: A deal can have many associated timeline events.Deal ←M-to-M→ User (StarredBy): Many users can star many deals.Deal ←M-to-M→ FundAllocation: A deal can be allocated to multiple funds (e.g., across different tranches or fund vehicles), and a fund can have many deals allocated to it.Deal ←1-to-M→ Document: A deal can have multiple associated documents (pitch decks, term sheets, etc.).Fund ←1-to-M→ FundAllocation: A fund can have many deals allocated to it.Fund ←1-to-M→ Distribution: A fund can issue multiple distributions.User roles via RoleAssignment tableDeal includes a foreign key reference to the Sector table.6. User Stories (Selected)These stories provide a user-centric perspective on key functionalities, highlighting the desired outcome and value for different roles.As an Analyst, when I forward a pitch-deck email, the deal lands in “New” with the deck attached so I can add initial notes in < 2 min, and the system prompts me to select the appropriate sector.As a Partner, I want a daily digest of new “Screening” deals and a one-click pass/advance link, and I want to easily filter this list to see deals only in the Technology sector.As an LP, I log in and see quarterly fund IRR and my individual capital account without seeing other investors’ data, and I want to see a breakdown of my capital and performance by the sectors within the fund.As Compliance, I can pull an export of every memo and email for a given deal within 24 hours, and this export includes the deal's sector classification.As a Partner, I want to view a dashboard showing the distribution of deals in our pipeline across different sectors to identify areas of concentration or gaps.As an Analyst, when writing a Mini-Memo, I want a dedicated field to explain how the deal fits within its specific sector trends and competitive landscape.7.
