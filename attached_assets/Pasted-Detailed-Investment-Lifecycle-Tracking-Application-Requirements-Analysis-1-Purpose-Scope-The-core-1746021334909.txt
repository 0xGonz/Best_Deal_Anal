Error handling for parsing failures and spam filtering are critical. The auto-tagging with date received and default stage ensures a consistent starting point for all ingested deals.

Technical Considerations: Requires integration with email protocols (IMAP/POP3 or cloud-specific APIs), robust text parsing libraries, and secure attachment handling/storage.

Manual & Bulk Add:

Analysis: Provides flexibility for deals sourced outside of email or for initial data migration. The quick-add modal prioritizes speed for initial entry, while CSV/XLS import caters to larger datasets from conferences or third-party platforms. Data validation during manual and bulk entry is essential to maintain data quality.

Technical Considerations: Requires user-friendly form design with input validation and a robust data import module capable of handling different file formats and mapping columns.

CRUD & Metadata:

Analysis: The core data structure for tracking deals. The defined fields capture essential information throughout the lifecycle. The ability to add custom tags/categories provides flexibility for internal classification and reporting. Implementing robust data validation rules is crucial to ensure data consistency and reliability for downstream processes like performance calculations and AI analysis.

Technical Considerations: Requires a well-designed database schema and a flexible UI for editing deal details.

Pipeline View:

Analysis: The central hub for managing deal flow. A well-designed pipeline view provides immediate visibility into the volume and status of deals at each stage. Filtering and sorting capabilities are essential for users to quickly find relevant deals. Visual indicators (e.g., color-coding by stage or status) enhance scannability.

Technical Considerations: Requires efficient database querying and a responsive front-end component capable of displaying and manipulating large datasets.

3.2 Pipeline & Workflow
The defined workflow stages represent the critical steps in Doliver's investment process. The transitions between stages are "gates" that require specific actions and artifacts, ensuring a standardized and auditable process.

Analysis: Each stage transition should be explicitly triggered by a user action (e.g., "Mark as Screening Complete"). The requirement for specific artifacts at each gate ensures that necessary documentation is completed before moving forward. Automated notifications via Slack/Teams and email are vital for keeping the team informed and driving action. Auto-timestamping the Deal Timeline provides an immutable record of process progression, crucial for compliance and post-mortem analysis.

Technical Considerations: Requires implementing state machine logic for deal stages, integration with notification APIs (Slack, Teams, Email), and ensuring atomic updates to the Deal record and Timeline.

3.3 Deal Timeline & Notes
Provides the historical context and collaborative workspace for each deal.

Analysis: The vertical timeline offers a chronological view of all significant events related to a deal, creating a comprehensive audit trail. Markdown/RTF notes with @mentions facilitate rich, collaborative discussions and documentation. Global search across notes and attachments is a critical feature for knowledge retrieval and due diligence.

Technical Considerations: Requires a dedicated data model for timeline events, a rich text editor with mention functionality, and a robust search index (e.g., Elasticsearch) for efficient full-text search across notes and document content.

3.4 Leaderboard & Investment Theses
A mechanism for collaborative evaluation and ranking of deals by the investment team.

Analysis: The "starring" mechanism allows users to signal interest, while the structured Mini-Memo ensures a consistent framework for evaluating key aspects of a deal. The weighted scoring based on user roles introduces a hierarchy to the ranking, reflecting the influence of different team members. Real-time reactivity of the leaderboard encourages engagement and provides immediate feedback on deal perception.

Technical Considerations: Requires a data model to capture user stars, Mini-Memos, and role weights. The leaderboard table requires dynamic calculation and sorting based on weighted scores. Real-time updates may require websockets or similar technologies.

3.5 AI Analyst Module
Leveraging AI to provide an objective perspective and synthesize team insights.

Analysis: This module adds significant analytical value by aggregating diverse opinions, identifying potential inconsistencies, and generating a concise summary. Detecting contradictory assumptions is a powerful feature for highlighting areas requiring further diligence. The AI Summary Memo provides a valuable starting point for the final IC memo. The ability to run on-demand allows for quick analysis during critical review periods.

Technical Considerations: Requires integration with a Large Language Model (LLM) API. The system needs to preprocess Mini-Memos, structure the prompt for the LLM, and parse the LLM's response. Careful consideration of data privacy and security is needed, especially if using external LLMs. The output needs to be stored and associated with the Deal record.

3.6 Fund Allocation & Post-Close Tracking
Managing investments once capital has been deployed and monitoring their performance over time.

Analysis: The Fund Catalogue provides structure for organizing investments. The one-click allocation simplifies the process of moving a deal from the pipeline to an invested state, capturing essential details like amount and security type. The performance dashboards are critical for understanding the health of the portfolio at both the fund and individual deal levels. Calculating and displaying key metrics like IRR, MOIC, and TVPI requires accurate tracking of cash flows (contributions and distributions) and valuations. The waterfall visual provides a clear picture of capital movement. LP views are essential for transparent reporting to limited partners, requiring strict permissioning.

Technical Considerations: Requires a data model for Funds, Investments, Distributions, and Valuations. Implementing accurate IRR and MOIC calculations requires careful handling of cash flow timing and amounts. Dashboard visualizations require integration with charting libraries. Robust permissioning is needed for LP views.
