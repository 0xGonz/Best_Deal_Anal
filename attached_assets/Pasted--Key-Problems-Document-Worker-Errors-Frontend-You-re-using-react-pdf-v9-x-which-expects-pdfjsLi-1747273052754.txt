 Key Problems
Document Worker Errors (Frontend):

You‚Äôre using react-pdf v9.x, which expects pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc to match pdfjs-dist v4 path.

Replit is serving an incorrect MIME (text/html) for a .mjs file. This causes "Setting up fake worker failed" errors.

The issue arises because Vite doesn't support dynamic import of worker files as-is when hosted this way.

Document Download Pathing (Backend):

server/routes/documents.ts returns paths that rely on local FS storage.

Replit‚Äôs filesystem is ephemeral and may not serve static files reliably after restarts unless manually persisted.

Capital Call Calendar Discrepancies:

Call/payment dates in the calendar don‚Äôt sync properly with backend logic.

"Single-payment" capital calls are showing 100% called even when they‚Äôre only partially called.

Missing Error Boundaries in PDF Viewer:

The PdfViewer component crashes silently or shows generic errors when it cannot fetch the PDF or worker script.

üîß Fixes & Improvements
üîÅ Modularization
Extract PDF logic into client/src/lib/pdf.ts:

Centralize GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc configuration.

Use a CDN like:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { GlobalWorkerOptions } from 'pdfjs-dist/build/pdf';
GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/pdfjs-dist@4.8.69/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs`;
Refactor Upload Logic (Documents):

Move upload handling and drag-drop logic into a separate hook: useDocumentUploader.ts.

Create a new backend service document.service.ts to isolate logic like file path generation, validation, and cleanup.

üîê Improve Document Persistence on Replit
Uploads should go into replit.persistent/ or /mnt/data/ (depending on your deployment setup).

Backend download route should check fs.existsSync(path) before sending file and log if missing.

üìÖ Calendar + Capital Call Integration
Move capital call logic into a centralized file:

capitalCall.service.ts should compute called vs uncalled, due dates, and provide filtered events by date.

Add a backend /capital-calls/fund/:fundId/summary endpoint to return:

Total commitment, total called, uncalled, and upcoming call dates.
