Below is a top-down checklist of the places where I keep seeing the “hidden disconnect” between your Postgres layer and what the React UI actually renders. Use it as a punch-list: start with the red items (they cause the wrong numbers to show), then the yellow (they cause crashes), and finally the nice-to-haves that will make the whole thing modular & scalable.

1 Data model ⟷ API layer (server)
🔍 What to verify	Typical break	How to fix / harden
Drizzle/Prisma schema matches the live enum & column types	Postgres has enum fund_allocation_status = (…), but Drizzle model was edited locally and a migration never ran. API returns wrong choices, UI hard-codes fall-backs.	- Run drizzle-kit diff (or Prisma db pull) against prod.
- Apply missing migrations.
Calculated columns are done in SQL, not piecemeal in controllers	Totals (e.g. “capital called”) are built in TS loops; when you add a new status, sums silently skip it.	Use database views or materialised views:
create view vw_fund_metrics as … so every consumer gets identical numbers.
Single source of truth for status transitions	Some controllers call updateAllocationStatus(); others run db.update().set({status:…}) inline.	Expose a AllocationService.changeStatus(id,newStatus) and call that everywhere; enforce allowed transitions inside the service.
Amount ≥ 0 rule differs by status	Zod says .positive(), DB allows 0, UI sends 0 for “committed” — you get 500s.	Change to:
amount: z.number().min(0) AND add a guard in service: if status in ('funded','partially_paid') then amount>0.
Foreign keys for pipeline⇄fund link	UI sends dealId from pipeline, but fund‐allocation row expects a separate “fund_deal_id”; FK fails → 500.	Add nullable pipeline_deal_id column (FK to pipeline table) and accept it in DTO.

2 API ⟷ Front-end
🔍 What to verify	Typical break	How to fix / harden
Route path consistency	FE queries /api/allocations; backend only mounts /api/production/allocations → 404.	Either
• add an alias app.use('/api/allocations', productionAllocRouter) or
• change all React Query keys.
Error payloads are surfaced	Express default handler returns plain 500; FE shows {}; you can’t debug.	Wrap every controller in
try/catch (err instanceof ZodError ? res.status(400).json(err.errors) : res.status(500)… )
Lists & dropdowns are never hard-coded in React	Status list in <Select> is [ 'committed','funded','invested' ] but api returns only [ 'committed','funded' ] → user can pick an invalid value.	Fetch GET /api/enums/fund_allocation_status on app load and drive all selects from that.
Queries are invalidated after mutations	Allocation POST succeeds but queryClient.invalidateQueries('allocations') is missing, so UI shows stale cash totals until refresh.	In every useMutation, add { onSuccess: () => qc.invalidateQueries('allocations') }.

3 Front-end rendering / state
🔍 What to verify	Typical break	How to fix / harden
One global currency / precision helper	You format amount.toLocaleString('en-US',{style:'currency'}) in five different components; one forgets decimals and rounds $42.55 to $43.	Centralise: import { formatMoney } from '@/utils/formatters'.
Agg totals are recomputed from query data, not props-drilled numbers	Fund dashboard receives initialTotals prop (snapshot at page load); after edits numbers don’t move.	Kill the prop; compute const totals = useMemo(()=>sumBy(queryData,'amount'),[queryData]).
Table rows keyed by stable IDs	key={deal.name} — rename the deal and React remounts the row, dropping inline edit state.	Use deal.id.

4 Dev & Ops hygiene (prevents “it worked on Replit”)
npm run lint && npm run typecheck in pre-commit – catches the undefined service instance before it hits prod.

POST /health endpoint – runs select 1 against Postgres and calls an in-process aggregate (e.g. AllocationService.getTotalAUM()) so you’re warned when a schema change breaks calculations.

Seed script in /prisma/seed.ts – populates a demo fund, two deals, and fixture allocations; CI runs Cypress against that so you never ship a front-end built against stale API shapes.

Quick wins you can ship today
Priority	Patch
🔥 High	1. Add alias or change FE to hit /api/production/allocations.
2. Wrap controllers with Zod/500 handler so you see why it fails.
3. In FE helper, clone response before text() or return res.json() directly – kills “body stream already read”.
⚡ Medium	4. Move “capital called” & “NAV” maths into a Postgres view so every screen shows identical numbers.
5. Centralise enum fetch for dropdowns.
🌱 Low	6. Replace manual totals with useMemo on query data.
7. Add healthcheck & seed-CI so the drift never creeps back.

Follow those steps and you’ll eliminate the silent divergences between the DB and what Gonz (a-k-a you) sees on-screen, while setting the codebase up for scale instead of more hard-coded patches. Let me know which item you tackle first and I can walk you through the implementation line-by-line.
