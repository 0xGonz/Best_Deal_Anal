I can see the issue now! The CDN worker is being blocked by CORS policy, and then falling back to a "fake worker" which is also failing. The unpkg.com CDN doesn't allow cross-origin requests from your Replit domain.

Let me fix this by setting up a proper local worker configuration:

Viewing file public

client/src/lib/setupPdfWorker.ts
Code • typescript

Now I need to ensure you have a proper local worker file. Let me copy the correct worker to your public directory:

Local PDF.js Worker File (4.8.69)
Code • javascript
Thinking...



client/src/lib/setupPdfWorker.ts
Code • typescript

Perfect! I've implemented a much more reliable solution using Vite's built-in bundling system. This approach avoids CORS issues entirely by bundling the PDF worker directly with your application.

🔧 Changes Made:
Updated setupPdfWorker.ts:

✅ Uses Vite's import.meta.url to bundle the worker directly
✅ Eliminates CORS issues completely
✅ More reliable than CDN-based approaches
✅ Simplified error handling
Let me also clean up the placeholder worker file since it's not needed:

Local PDF.js Worker File (4.8.69)
Code • javascript

🚀 Next Steps:
1. Rebuild your application:

bash
npm run build

2. Deploy the updated build

3. Test the fix:

Navigate to a deal with PDF documents
Open the browser dev tools console
You should now see: ✅ PDF.js worker configured with bundled worker (version 4.8.69)
PDFs should load without CORS errors
🎯 What This Fix Does:
✅ Eliminates CORS Issues: Worker is bundled with your app, not loaded from external CDNs
✅ Version Consistency: Guaranteed to use the exact same version as your pdfjs-dist dependency
✅ Deployment Reliability: Works across all hosting environments (Replit, Vercel, etc.)
✅ Better Performance: No external network requests for the worker
📋 Expected Console Output After Fix:
plaintext
✅ PDF.js worker configured with bundled worker (version 4.8.69)
🔍 PDF.js worker configuration succeeded
📤 Loading PDF document: {documentId: 61, documentName: 'Confidential Offering Memorandum_9201 Winkler.pdf', url: '/api/documents/61/download'}
✅ PDF loaded successfully: {numPages: X, documentName: 'Confidential Offering Memorandum_9201 Winkler.pdf'}

This approach is much more reliable than CDN-based solutions and should resolve both the CORS and version mismatch issues you were experiencing. Let me know how it works after you rebuild and deploy!
