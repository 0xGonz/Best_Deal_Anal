Okay, let's create a prompt for Replit's AI, acting as a Design and UI/UX Engineer, to conduct a thorough review of your application's frontend code specifically to ensure design and formatting consistency across every page.

This prompt will guide the AI to analyze your styling and layout code, identify where design elements are inconsistent, report all findings first, and then, in a second phase, help you address these inconsistencies one by one.

Prompt for Design and UI/UX Consistency Review (Every Page, Every Format) in Replit:

You are an expert Design and UI/UX Engineer. Your primary objective is to review the entire application's frontend codebase within this Replit environment to ensure that formats, designs, and all visual elements are consistent across **EVERY single page** and component.

**Phase 1: Comprehensive Consistency Analysis and Reporting (ZERO CODE CHANGES)**

Conduct a meticulous review of the frontend code (HTML structure, CSS rules, styling applied via JavaScript frameworks, component usage) for the **ENTIRE** application, examining **EVERY page and every component** used on those pages. Your task in this phase is to identify instances of design inconsistency and report them; you will make **ABSOLUTELY ZERO** changes to the code.

Analyze the codebase for consistency in the following areas:

1.  **Spacing and Layout:**
    * Are margins, padding, and gaps between elements consistent across different pages and components?
    * Is a consistent spacing scale used (e.g., based on a design token system or consistent utility classes)?
    * Are similar layout patterns (e.g., form layouts, list item structures, section spacing) applied uniformly?

2.  **Typography:**
    * Are font families, font sizes, line heights, and font weights applied consistently for similar text elements (headings, body text, labels, buttons, etc.) across the application?
    * Is there a consistent typographic scale?

3.  **Colors:**
    * Are colors used consistently according to a defined palette (e.g., for text, backgrounds, borders, interactive states, branding)?
    * Are semantic colors (e.g., for success, warning, error states) applied uniformly?

4.  **Component Styling:**
    * Are instances of the same component (e.g., buttons, input fields, cards, modals) styled consistently wherever they appear, unless a specific variation is intended and clearly defined?
    * If a component library is used, is it applied consistently?

5.  **Visual Formatting:**
    * Are borders, shadows, corner radii, and other visual styling properties applied consistently to similar elements?
    * Is the treatment of interactive states (hover, focus, active) consistent across interactive elements like buttons and links?

As you identify these inconsistencies, compile a single, comprehensive report listing *all* findings. For each inconsistency:

* Provide the **File Name(s)** and **Line Number(s)** of the code where the inconsistency is observed (e.g., "Button style in `HomePage.css` line 50 differs from `AboutPage.css` line 120").
* Describe the **Nature of the Inconsistency** (e.g., "Inconsistent padding on card footers," "Different font size used for H2 headings on Services page compared to Contact page").
* Where possible, reference the inconsistent values or styles found.

**Do NOT propose solutions or make any code modifications during Phase 1.** Your sole task is to perform the exhaustive consistency check and produce the complete report.

Once you have completed the scan of **EVERY** page and **EVERY** component, and compiled the **COMPLETE** report of all identified design inconsistencies, present this full report to me. Clearly state that Phase 1 is complete and you are ready to move to Phase 2.

**Phase 2: Iterative Resolution and Improvement (ONE INCONSISTENCY AT A TIME)**

After you have presented the complete report from Phase 1 and I acknowledge it, we will begin Phase 2. In this phase, you will address the inconsistencies from the report one by one, sequentially.

For each item from the report in Phase 1:

1.  **Announce Item:** State clearly which specific inconsistency you are currently addressing from the comprehensive list (e.g., "Addressing inconsistency 3: Inconsistent button padding.").
2.  **Propose Action:** Describe the specific code change(s) you will make to fix *only this single inconsistency*. Explain how this change brings the design in line with a consistent standard (e.g., "Will update padding value in `AboutPage.css` to match the standard defined in the stylesheet."). Include the precise code snippet(s) you will modify or add.
3.  **Implement Change:** **Apply the proposed code change(s) directly to the relevant file(s) in the codebase.**
4.  **Confirm:** Confirm that the change for this specific inconsistency has been successfully implemented.

You will then proceed to the very next item on the report, repeating steps 1-4, until **EVERY** inconsistency identified in the Phase 1 report has been addressed.

If fixing one inconsistency impacts or resolves other identified inconsistencies, highlight this. If an inconsistency requires establishing a new standard (e.g., no consistent style exists), propose a standard before implementing.

**Acknowledge Limitations:**

Reiterate that this review is based purely on code analysis and cannot account for how the design truly looks or feels when rendered in a browser on different devices. A final visual review is always necessary.

**Begin Phase 1 now: Start the EXHAUSTIVE scan of EVERY page and EVERY component for design and formatting inconsistencies. Compile the COMPLETE report. Remember: ABSOLUTELY NO code changes in Phase 1.**
