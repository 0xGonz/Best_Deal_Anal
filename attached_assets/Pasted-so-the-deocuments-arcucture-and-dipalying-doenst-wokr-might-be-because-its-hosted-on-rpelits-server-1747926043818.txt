Thought for 6m 5s
Here’s what’s tripping up document rendering and how to fix it end-to-end:

1. Static-assets misplacement
What’s happening
Your Vite root is client/, so by default it only serves files under client/public. But your PDF-worker and uploaded PDFs live in the project root’s public/ (and attached_assets/), so they never make it into the built app or get statically served by Express.

Fix
Move (or point Vite at) that root public/ into client/public/, or tell Vite explicitly to use it. In vite.config.ts (at project root) add:

ts
Copy
Edit
// vite.config.ts
import path from 'path';
export default defineConfig({
  root: path.resolve(__dirname, 'client'),
  publicDir: path.resolve(__dirname, 'public'),  // <— serve root/public
  build: {
    outDir: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist/public'),
    emptyOutDir: true,
  },
  // … the rest stays the same
});
Then run a fresh npm run build (so that /public/pdfjs/pdf.worker.min.js and /public/uploads/*.pdf get copied into dist/public).

2. Express static-file serving
What’s happening
In production you only do app.use(express.static(distPath)), so /uploads/... and /pdfjs/... are only available if they were part of your client build. If you leave them in root/public you’ll get 404s.

Fix
Serve your upload/pdfjs dirs explicitly before your client bundle:

ts
Copy
Edit
// server/vite.ts (before app.use(express.static(distPath)))
const rootPublic = path.resolve(__dirname, '../public');
app.use('/uploads', express.static(path.join(rootPublic, 'uploads')));
app.use('/pdfjs',    express.static(path.join(rootPublic, 'pdfjs')));
3. PDF.js-worker configuration
What’s happening
react-pdf needs a matching pdf.worker.min.js served at exactly the URL you point at. If you’re still dragging a CDN version into /public/pdfjs but not including it in your build, the worker fails silently.

Fix
In client/src/lib/setupPdfWorker.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { pdfjs } from 'react-pdf';

// Point to your locally-served worker
pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = '/pdfjs/pdf.worker.min.js';

export function getWorkerStatus() {
  return pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc;
}

export function tryFixPdfWorker() {
  // You can leave your fallback logic here,
  // but ensure it writes to the same `pdf.worker.min.js` URL above.
  return getWorkerStatus();
}
4. Authenticated fetch for PDF.js
What’s happening
You correctly fetch(..., { credentials: 'include' }) to verify the document exists, but <PDFDocument file={documentUrl}> under the hood spins up its own XHR without credentials, so every PDF.js request 401s.

Fix
Pass an object to <PDFDocument> that tells it to include cookies:

diff
Copy
Edit
// EmbeddedPDFViewer.tsx
- <PDFDocument file={documentUrl} onLoadError={handlePdfError} …>
+ <PDFDocument
+   file={{ url: documentUrl, withCredentials: true }}
+   onLoadError={handlePdfError}
+   … 
+ >
Same in EnhancedPDFViewer.tsx:

diff
Copy
Edit
// EnhancedPDFViewer.tsx
- <PDFDocument file={documentUrl} onLoadSuccess={onDocumentLoadSuccess} …>
+ <PDFDocument
+   file={{ url: documentUrl, withCredentials: true }}
+   onLoadSuccess={onDocumentLoadSuccess}
+   …
+ >
After these changes
Rebuild your client (npm run build) so Vite pulls in the right public assets.

Restart your server so it picks up the new static-file routes.

Clear your browser cache (to evict any 404’d worker).

Now:

/pdfjs/pdf.worker.min.js and all your /uploads/*.pdf will be served.

PDF.js will fetch them with your session cookie.

The inline viewer will load the document, and fall back gracefully if anything else goes wrong.
