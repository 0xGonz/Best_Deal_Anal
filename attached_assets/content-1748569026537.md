# PDF Display Issues in Production – Analysis and Fixes

## Document Storage and Retrieval in the App

In the **DealFlowLifecyclev1** codebase, documents are uploaded and stored on the server’s filesystem, with metadata in the database. When a file is uploaded via the API, the backend saves it under an `uploads` directory and records its info in the `documents` table. For example, on upload the server constructs a file path and stores it in the DB (along with original filename and type)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L327-L335). The file itself is written to `./uploads` on the server host using Multer (disk storage)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L20-L29)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L327-L335).

To **display** these documents, the frontend React app uses a PDF viewer (for PDFs) or provides a download. The client’s `EmbeddedPDFViewer` component attempts to render PDFs with the **react-pdf** library. It loads the PDF from a REST endpoint ( `GET /api/documents/:id/download`) which streams the file content[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L161-L169)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L173-L181). If the PDF.js-based viewer fails, it falls back to embedding the PDF in an `<iframe>` (using the same download URL)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/client/src/components/documents/EmbeddedPDFViewer.tsx#L259-L267). Other file types (e.g. .docx, .xlsx) aren’t rendered inline by this component – those would default to a download link.

**Backend serving of files:** The download route checks the DB for the document’s stored `filePath` and `fileName`, then tries to locate the file on disk[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L124-L132)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L140-L148). Once found, it sets appropriate response headers – notably `Content-Type` based on file extension and `Content-Disposition: inline` for PDFs[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L161-L169)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L173-L181) – and streams the file to the client. In development mode, Vite’s dev server proxies these calls, whereas in production the Express server serves the React build and this API on the same domain.

Given this setup, the **discrepancy between development and production** likely stems from environment differences in file storage and loading. Let’s examine the key issues that would cause PDFs to display in dev but fail in production, and how to fix them.

## Issue 1: Ephemeral File Storage in Production (Missing Files)

A primary cause of “PDF failed to load” in production is that **uploaded files are not persistent on the deployed environment**. In development (running on your machine or a Replit workspace), the `uploads` directory persists between runs, so PDFs remain available. However, on the deployed app (likely hosted on Replit’s deployment infrastructure), the filesystem resets on each restart or deploy. The code saves files to a relative `uploads` path by default[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L327-L335), which on Replit’s server may **not survive** redeployments. As a result, a PDF that was uploaded can disappear in production after a server restart, even though its database record still exists. This leads to 404 errors when the client tries to fetch the file (the backend can’t find it on disk). The frontend viewer then either shows an error or just a blank/garbled area (sometimes appearing as “raw HTML” or a missing PDF message in the viewer UI).

In the repository’s notes, this is confirmed as a problem: _“Uploaded PDFs are written to .../uploads... which on Replit is not persisted across restarts. Thus a newly uploaded PDF can render once, but after a restart the physical file is gone even though the DB record remains.”_ [GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/attached_assets/Pasted-Confirmed-Issues-and-Causes-PDF-js-Worker-Misconfiguration-The-app-s-setupPdfWorker-ts-hard-codes-a-1748394297141.txt#L8-L12). This explains why it “works in development” (persistent local disk) but fails in production after a deploy.

**Fix – Use persistent storage or external store:** To resolve this, the file storage mechanism must be made persistent in production. Possible solutions:

- **Use a persistent directory or volume** if Replit offers one. For example, the notes suggest using a special path (like a `replit-storage` directory) that isn’t wiped on restart[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/attached_assets/Pasted-Confirmed-Issues-and-Causes-PDF-js-Worker-Misconfiguration-The-app-s-setupPdfWorker-ts-hard-codes-a-1748394297141.txt#L58-L61). Ensuring `multer` writes to that location (and adjusting the download path accordingly) would keep files around. The `uploads` directory could be moved under a persistent path (or an environment-specific path) in production.

- **Alternatively, use an external storage service** (like AWS S3, or a database BLOB) for documents. In a quick fix scenario, one could store the file bytes in the database, but that’s not ideal for large files. A better approach is to configure the app to upload to cloud storage and just save the URL/keys in the DB.

- At minimum, if sticking with local FS on Replit, you might configure the deployment to mount a volume or avoid resetting certain folders. If that’s not possible, treating the storage as ephemeral and warning users (or re-uploading on each deploy) isn’t really acceptable, so a persistent strategy is needed.


In short, **the production app needs a stable place for files**. Until this is fixed, you will continue to see “file not found” errors (e.g. `MissingPDFException`) in the PDF viewer whenever the app is redeployed or the container restarts.

## Issue 2: PDF Worker Configuration and Viewer Errors

Another production-only issue is the **PDF.js worker misconfiguration**. The React-PDF library uses a web-worker script to parse PDFs in the background. In development, you might not have noticed problems (perhaps because the dev server handled module imports differently or showed only a warning), but in the production build the worker failed to load. Symptoms include console errors like _“Failed to load PDF worker”_ or _“Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: pdf.worker.js”_, and the PDF content not rendering at all. This could also manifest as the viewer showing raw text or a blank area.

**Cause:** Looking at the code, initially the PDF worker source was likely not set up correctly for the bundled app. The repo’s notes confirm a mismatch: _“The app’s setupPdfWorker.ts hard-codes a worker URL... Vite never bundles the worker file, so React-PDF falls back to a ‘fake worker’ and then fails – producing the error Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: pdf.worker.js… Moreover, the default bundled worker was version 3.x, causing a version mismatch with pdfjs-dist 4.x.”_ [GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/attached_assets/Pasted-Confirmed-Issues-and-Causes-PDF-js-Worker-Misconfiguration-The-app-s-setupPdfWorker-ts-hard-codes-a-1748394297141.txt#L2-L10). Essentially, the front-end might have been trying to load a worker at `/pdf.worker.js` or using an outdated CDN path, which wasn’t actually present in the production build. The server’s catch-all routing likely served the main `index.html` in place of the missing worker script, hence the viewer getting **HTML instead of the worker JS**, leading to console errors and a non-functional PDF viewer.

We can see the fix implemented in code: the `client/src/lib/setupPdfWorker.ts` now explicitly sets the worker to the correct version hosted on a CDN (unpkg for pdfjs-dist 4.8.69)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/18b93c7afdac7447443dee5f7e39467f4bad8505/client/src/lib/setupPdfWorker.ts#L10-L17). This ensures the browser loads a valid PDF.js worker script. In a proper fix, one could also bundle the worker using Vite’s asset plugin (e.g. importing `pdf.worker.min.js?url` to get a deployable asset[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/attached_assets/Pasted-Confirmed-Issues-and-Causes-PDF-js-Worker-Misconfiguration-The-app-s-setupPdfWorker-ts-hard-codes-a-1748394297141.txt#L48-L56)), but using the CDN URL is a quick solution.

**Fix – Load the correct PDF.js worker:** Make sure the worker script is configured to match your PDF library version and is accessible in production. The current code sets `pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc` to the matching version on unpkg[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/18b93c7afdac7447443dee5f7e39467f4bad8505/client/src/lib/setupPdfWorker.ts#L10-L17) – that should resolve the “failed to load” worker errors. After this fix, the browser’s network tab should show the `pdf.worker.min.js` being loaded successfully (HTTP 200) rather than a 404 or HTML content. This addresses the **“failed to load”** PDF issue. If any _“failed to cache PDF”_ message was appearing, it might have been related to the worker failing or a service-worker caching issue; fixing the worker loading likely resolves it. (If “failed to cache” was a message from a service worker, ensure your app’s service worker – if any – isn’t mishandling PDF requests. There’s no custom service worker in this app by default, so it was likely the worker script error.)

Additionally, after ensuring the worker loads, keep an eye on **PDF.js version compatibility**. The react-pdf library v9 expects a particular pdf.js version. The notes indicate the app had version mismatches before. Always use a worker from the same pdfjs-dist version as your package to avoid subtle errors. With the current approach, that is handled by pinning the CDN URL to the exact version.

## Issue 3: MIME Types and Content Handling

For PDFs and other documents to display correctly, the server must send the correct MIME type and headers. In the current implementation, the download route does set these headers based on file extension[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L161-L169). In particular, PDFs are served with `Content-Type: application/pdf` and an `inline` disposition so that the browser (or PDF viewer library) can render them in situ[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L173-L181). This is correct, and it matches what we see in code. So, MIME type likely isn’t the culprit anymore (the PDFs are not being served as raw HTML or text by the backend).

However, if earlier the static file serving was attempted, there could have been an issue. Notice that the Express app also mounts a static server for the `uploads` folder[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/index.ts#L185-L189). If a PDF was accessed via the static route (e.g. `https://your-app/uploads/filename.pdf`), Express would serve it directly. Typically, static serving would also set the `Content-Type` based on the file extension (so it should still be `application/pdf`). That should be fine. But one thing to watch: **double-handling of routes**. The code mounts static `/uploads` **before** the API routes[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/index.ts#L185-L191). In most cases the front-end uses the API route (with auth) to fetch the file, not the static route. That’s good for security (requires a session). But if a stray request did hit the static route for a missing file, Express might return a default 404 HTML page (which, if inadvertently loaded in the viewer, would appear as “raw HTML”). There’s also a note that the `filePath` stored in DB sometimes included a leading slash which confused path resolution[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/attached_assets/Pasted-Confirmed-Issues-and-Causes-PDF-js-Worker-Misconfiguration-The-app-s-setupPdfWorker-ts-hard-codes-a-1748394297141.txt#L13-L19). For instance, if `filePath` was stored as `"/uploads/abc123.pdf"`, then `path.join(process.cwd(), 'public', filePath)` would mistakenly point to `/uploads/...` at the server root. This could cause the file lookup to fail even if the file exists under `public/uploads`. In the current upload code, `filePath` is stored without a leading slash ( `uploads/…`)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L331-L335), which is correct. So just ensure all existing DB entries follow that format (the provided `scripts/fix-document-paths.js` was used to normalize this[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/scripts/fix-document-paths.js#L74-L83)).

**Fix – verify headers and path usage:** It looks like the code already handles MIME types properly and has adjusted the path issues. To be safe, you can add additional headers to prevent any content confusion. For example, sending `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` along with the file response can help the browser treat it strictly as PDF. But this is a minor hardening – the core MIME issue is fine as long as `Content-Type` is correct (which it is for PDFs[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L161-L169)). The “raw HTML” symptom was likely due to the worker or file-not-found scenario, not an actual MIME misclassification of a PDF. After fixes, a found PDF will be delivered as PDF and render, and an unfound file will return a JSON error (caught by the viewer and shown as a user-friendly message, not raw HTML).

## Issue 4: CORS and Authentication in Production

Because the app uses authenticated routes to fetch documents, differences in how cookies or CORS are handled can affect production. In development, you probably run the client and server on the same origin (especially if using the integrated Vite dev proxy or running everything on localhost), so authentication works seamlessly. In production, the client is served by the same Express app (same domain), so it’s still a single origin. That means **CORS issues should be minimal**, since the browser isn’t actually doing cross-origin requests (the origin is the same for app pages and API). Even so, the server has a permissive CORS middleware enabled, which sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the request’s origin (or `*`) and allows credentials[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/index.ts#L127-L135). This indicates the intent to allow cross-site embedding if needed. (One thing to note: if `'*'` is returned while also `Allow-Credentials: true`, modern browsers will ignore the response because `*` with credentials is not allowed. The code avoids this by echoing `req.headers.origin` when present[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/index.ts#L127-L135), which is correct for credentialed requests.)

The **bigger concern is cookies over HTTPS**. In production mode, the session cookie is marked `Secure` (only sent over HTTPS) and `SameSite: lax` [GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/index.ts#L152-L160). On Replit’s hosted domain (which uses HTTPS), this is fine. But if you ever access the app via an HTTP URL or a custom domain without HTTPS, the cookie wouldn’t be sent and the document request would get a 401 Unauthorized (because `requireAuth` would fail)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L12-L20). This could look like “PDF failed to load” as well. The fix here is mostly **configuration**: ensure you always use HTTPS in production (which you likely do on Replit). If a custom domain is in play, get TLS set up so that `Secure` cookies are honored. The fact that development worked (where `secure` was false) and if production was accidentally accessed in a non-HTTPS way could cause a difference. So double-check the deployed URL scheme.

On the client side, the fetch in the PDF viewer explicitly includes credentials ( `fetch(documentUrl, { credentials: 'include' })`)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/client/src/components/documents/EmbeddedPDFViewer.tsx#L38-L46), which is correct to send the session cookie along. The `<iframe>` fallback also uses the same origin (it’s pointing to your own domain), and you set `sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-forms"` [GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/client/src/components/documents/EmbeddedPDFViewer.tsx#L259-L267), meaning the iframe content is treated as same-origin and will receive cookies. So the setup is fine – just make sure the session is actually available. If you notice in production that the viewer still says “failed to load” and your network tab shows a 401 on the `.../download` request, it means the cookie wasn’t sent or recognized. In that case, the problem is likely misconfigured domain or cookies (e.g., accessing via wrong host or an issue with the proxy). The solution is to fix the deployment/config (for instance, if using a reverse proxy or different domain, adjust the cookie domain or ensure the path is correct).

In summary, **CORS and auth** don’t seem to be the root cause here given the app’s architecture (same origin). Just ensure the production environment doesn’t unintentionally block the cookie. The existing code already logs session info on auth routes for debugging[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/index.ts#L161-L169), so use those logs if needed to confirm the session is present in production.

## Issue 5: Caching Behavior

Another subtle factor: how caching is handled for the PDF content. If the browser or a proxy cached an error page or an old copy of the PDF, it could interfere with loading. The current download route doesn’t set explicit cache headers (in the code we have, it doesn’t set `Cache-Control`, so it may default to some standard or be cached by the browser). The repository analysis suggests adding a header to prevent caching: _“res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-store, must-revalidate')”_ for the download response[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/attached_assets/Pasted-Confirmed-Issues-and-Causes-PDF-js-Worker-Misconfiguration-The-app-s-setupPdfWorker-ts-hard-codes-a-1748394297141.txt#L95-L103). This is a good practice in this scenario. It ensures that when the user requests the PDF, it always fetches from the server and doesn’t use a stale cached version. This is especially important if you’ve re-uploaded a document with the same ID or if a previous attempt resulted in a 404 that got cached. Setting `no-store` and maybe unique query params for updates will avoid “failed to cache” issues.

**Fix – disable caching for document fetches:** You can update the download endpoint to include `res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-store')` (and/or `Pragma: no-cache` for HTTP/1.0) so that no intermediate cache will serve an outdated response[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/attached_assets/Pasted-Confirmed-Issues-and-Causes-PDF-js-Worker-Misconfiguration-The-app-s-setupPdfWorker-ts-hard-codes-a-1748394297141.txt#L95-L103). Also consider setting an `ETag` or version query if documents might change, but since each upload likely creates a new record/ID, caching is more likely to cause trouble than help. The goal is that when a user clicks a document, the browser always attempts a fresh GET. This way, if a file was missing and then fixed, or replaced, the user won’t get stuck with a cached error. It also means if the file truly is missing, the viewer’s HEAD check and subsequent GET will reliably get a 404/JSON error and not a cached 404 from earlier, allowing the app to show the proper message.

## Recommendations and Summary of Fixes

To get PDFs and other documents displaying correctly in production, implement the following fixes:

- **Use Persistent File Storage:** Configure file uploads to go to a persistent volume or storage service in production. On Replit, that might mean using a special directory that isn’t wiped on restart (as suggested, e.g. `replit-storage/uploads`) or an external store. This will prevent files from “vanishing” and causing 404 errors in the viewer[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/attached_assets/Pasted-Confirmed-Issues-and-Causes-PDF-js-Worker-Misconfiguration-The-app-s-setupPdfWorker-ts-hard-codes-a-1748394297141.txt#L8-L12). _(If persistent storage is not available, consider storing files in the database or switching to an S3 bucket. But on Replit, a persistent folder is likely easiest.)_

- **Fix PDF.js Worker Loading:** Ensure the PDF viewer’s worker script is properly included. The current fix in code uses the PDF.js CDN for the exact version[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/18b93c7afdac7447443dee5f7e39467f4bad8505/client/src/lib/setupPdfWorker.ts#L10-L17). This resolves the “failed to load PDF”/“failed to bootstrap worker” errors. In the long term, you can refine this by bundling the worker with Vite (using an import that yields a URL[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/attached_assets/Pasted-Confirmed-Issues-and-Causes-PDF-js-Worker-Misconfiguration-The-app-s-setupPdfWorker-ts-hard-codes-a-1748394297141.txt#L48-L56)) so you’re not dependent on an external CDN and there’s no version mismatch. After this fix, the React-PDF `<Document>` component should load without throwing worker-related exceptions.

- **Verify Response Headers:** Keep the correct `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition` for PDFs (which the code sets)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L173-L181). For other file types, the backend currently sets common types ( `.docx`, `.xlsx`, etc.)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/routes/documents.ts#L161-L169); ensure the client handles those (if not previewing, at least the download button uses `target="_blank"` or similar). The inline disposition for PDFs is correct – it allows in-browser viewing. Non-PDFs are set to `attachment` disposition in the code[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/attached_assets/Pasted-Confirmed-Issues-and-Causes-PDF-js-Worker-Misconfiguration-The-app-s-setupPdfWorker-ts-hard-codes-a-1748394297141.txt#L96-L104), prompting download, which is fine. These MIME details are mostly correct as-is.

- **Improve the Download Route Robustness:** Incorporate an upfront existence check and faster failure response for missing files. The current implementation tries a few fallback paths and only then returns a 404[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/attached_assets/Pasted-Confirmed-Issues-and-Causes-PDF-js-Worker-Misconfiguration-The-app-s-setupPdfWorker-ts-hard-codes-a-1748394297141.txt#L20-L28). You might simplify this: if the DB says the filePath is `uploads/XYZ.pdf`, just check that path (and perhaps one alternate) – if not found, respond 404 immediately with a JSON error. This way the viewer knows right away the file is gone. (The frontend already does a HEAD request and then GET to handle this gracefully[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/client/src/components/documents/EmbeddedPDFViewer.tsx#L38-L46)[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/client/src/components/documents/EmbeddedPDFViewer.tsx#L62-L70).) Cleaning up the path logic (and removing any leading slash issues) will also help[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/attached_assets/Pasted-Confirmed-Issues-and-Causes-PDF-js-Worker-Misconfiguration-The-app-s-setupPdfWorker-ts-hard-codes-a-1748394297141.txt#L13-L19). This isn’t so much a _fix_ for the display issue as it is a cleanup to make errors clearer and avoid long timeouts in the PDF.js fetch.

- **Set No-Cache Headers:** As noted, disable caching on file responses. Add `Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate` on the download response[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/attached_assets/Pasted-Confirmed-Issues-and-Causes-PDF-js-Worker-Misconfiguration-The-app-s-setupPdfWorker-ts-hard-codes-a-1748394297141.txt#L95-L103). This ensures that each request truly checks for the file’s existence on the server. It will prevent bizarre scenarios where a browser might cache a 404 page or an old PDF. Given that these documents can be sensitive and updated, it’s reasonable to always fetch them fresh (the performance impact is negligible compared to potential confusion with cached data).

- **Deployment Config Check (Cookies & CORS):** Confirm that the app is served over HTTPS so that the secure session cookie is sent. The client code is already including credentials on requests[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/client/src/components/documents/EmbeddedPDFViewer.tsx#L40-L46), and the server allows it[GitHub](https://github.com/0xGonz/DealFlowLifecyclev1/blob/54c9aee87f5b0cfa5907e85e2f7824d7499fe7e0/server/index.ts#L127-L135). If you ever separate the front-end and back-end (different domains), you’ll need to adjust the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the specific origin and keep credentials true – currently the server does that dynamically which should be fine. In the current single-app deployment, you shouldn’t need to change much here. Just be aware of it: if you see 401 errors in the network log for the PDF GET, it’s likely a cookie issue – then you’d inspect domain/secure flags.

- **Optional – Handling Non-PDFs:** Since the app supports uploading DOC, XLS, etc., consider how to display those. The current viewer will just show an error state for non-PDF files (since it only tries the PDF component or iframe if PDF) and provide a download link as a fallback. This is acceptable (the user can download and open locally). A nicer enhancement would be integrating an online viewer or preview (e.g., using Google Docs Viewer in an iframe for those formats). This isn’t strictly necessary, but it’s something to note for user experience consistency.


By addressing the **file persistence** and **PDF worker loading** especially, the production app should start displaying PDFs just as reliably as the dev environment. In summary, the core problems were environment-related: the files weren’t actually present in production (due to ephemeral storage) and the PDF renderer wasn’t fully configured for the production build. After implementing the above fixes, test the workflow again: upload a PDF, refresh the app (even redeploy if possible), and confirm you can still view the PDF in the embedded viewer without errors. Each of the adjustments will close the gap between the development experience and the production deployment, allowing documents to display correctly.
