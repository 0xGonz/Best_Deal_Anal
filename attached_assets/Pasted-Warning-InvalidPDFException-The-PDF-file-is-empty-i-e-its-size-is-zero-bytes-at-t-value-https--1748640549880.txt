Common causes:

File upload failed - The PDF didn't upload properly and resulted in an empty file
Corrupted file - The PDF got corrupted during transfer or storage
Wrong file path - Your code is pointing to a file that doesn't exist or is empty
File generation issue - If you're generating PDFs programmatically, the generation process failed

Solutions to try:

Check the file size - Verify that your PDF file actually has content and isn't 0 bytes
Re-upload the file - Try uploading the PDF again
Verify file path - Make sure your code is pointing to the correct file location
Test with a different PDF - Try loading a known-good PDF file to isolate the issue
Add error handling - Wrap your PDF loading code in try-catch blocks:

javascripttry {
  // Your PDF loading code here
} catch (error) {
  if (error.name === 'InvalidPDFException') {
    console.error('PDF file is empty or invalid');
    // Handle empty PDF case
  }
}

Check file before processing - Add a file size check before attempting to load:

javascriptif (file.size === 0) {
  console.error('PDF file is empty');
  return;
}
