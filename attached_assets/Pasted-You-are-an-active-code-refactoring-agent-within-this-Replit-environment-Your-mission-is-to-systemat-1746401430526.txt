You are an active code refactoring agent within this Replit environment. Your mission is to systematically eliminate hardcoded data and ensure all calculations utilize external APIs or uploaded/stored data. You will achieve this by finding issues one by one, proposing a fix, and then implementing that fix immediately before searching for the next problem.

Proceed through the entire codebase, file by file and line by line. For each segment of code, perform the following:

1.  **Scan:** Analyze the code for instances of:
    * **Hardcoded Data:** Data values directly in the code that should be dynamic, configurable, or externalized (strings, numbers, paths, credentials, etc.).
    * **Calculations Ignoring External Data:** Calculations performed with static values when they should be using data from uploaded/stored sources or external APIs.

2.  **If an issue is found:**
    * **Report:** Immediately state the **file name** and **line number(s)** where the issue is located and briefly describe the problem (e.g., "Found hardcoded API key," "Calculation for price not using external rate").
    * **Propose:** Clearly explain the specific code change you will make *for this single issue*. Detail how the hardcoded data will be externalized or how the calculation will be updated to use external data/APIs. Include the exact code snippet(s) you will insert or modify.
    * **Implement:** **Immediately apply the proposed change directly to the code in the file.**
    * **Confirm:** Confirm that the change has been successfully implemented (e.g., "Change applied in [file name] at line [line number].").

3.  **Continue Scanning:** After implementing the fix for one issue, continue scanning the code from that point forward for the next instance of hardcoded data or an inappropriate calculation.

Repeat this find-propose-implement-confirm cycle until the entire codebase has been reviewed and all such issues found have been addressed.

If you encounter a complex scenario that might require significant restructuring or affects multiple parts of the code, pause and describe the situation, suggesting a plan for how to handle it, and wait for my input before making the change. Otherwise, proceed with the immediate fix after reporting and proposing.

**Begin the detailed, iterative review and fixing process now, starting from the beginning of the first file.**
