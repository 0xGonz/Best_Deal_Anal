## AI Analyst Module: The AI Investment Committee Member

The AI Analyst Module is designed to act as an unbiased member of the investment committee, providing an objective analysis and recommendation on a deal based on all the accumulated data within the application. Its purpose is to offer a final, data-driven perspective before a critical investment decision is made.

### Core Functionality & Role

- **Unbiased Review:** The primary role of the AI Analyst is to provide an objective assessment. It analyzes the data without human biases, focusing purely on the information presented in the system.

- **Integrated Workflow Step:** The AI analysis is strategically placed in the workflow, triggered automatically when a deal reaches the 'AI Review' stage (REQ-4.2.3, REQ-4.6.1). This ensures every deal reaching this critical point receives an AI assessment. It can also be manually re-triggered on demand.

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis (REQ-4.6.2):** The AI doesn't just look at one type of data; it synthesizes information from multiple sources associated with a specific deal:

  - **The Deck/Documents:** Analyzes the content of uploaded documents, such as pitch decks and diligence reports (requires integration with document content extraction/analysis - REQ-5.8).

  - **Mini-Memos:** Aggregates and analyzes the structured input from the investment team's Mini-Memos (REQ-4.4.3).

  - **Timeline Notes:** Processes notes and summaries from the Deal Timeline (REQ-4.3.2).

  - **Leaderboard Rank:** Considers the deal's standing and user starring data from the Leaderboard (REQ-4.4.1, REQ-4.4.2).

  - **Deal Metadata:** Incorporates key information from the deal record itself (REQ-4.1.2), including sector, projected return, size, etc.

  - **Aggregated Pipeline Data:** May leverage insights from the overall pipeline data, such as conversion rates for similar deals (REQ-4.7.3).
- **Analysis and Recommendation Generation (REQ-4.6.3):** Based on its comprehensive analysis, the AI generates a structured output:

  - **AI Summary Memo:** A detailed memo summarizing its findings, including a synthesized investment thesis, key risks, a valuation sanity check, and open questions.

  - **Sector Fit Analysis:** Explicitly assesses how the deal fits within its sector and current market trends.

  - **Clear Recommendation:** Provides an explicit, unbiased recommendation (e.g., "Recommended for Investment," "Requires Further Diligence," "Not Recommended").

  - **Data Source Referencing:** Explicitly references the data sources it used for the analysis, providing transparency.

### Integration and Data Management

- **Triggering:** The AI analysis is triggered by the backend workflow logic when a deal enters the 'AI Review' stage or via a manual trigger initiated from the frontend (REQ-4.6.1).

- **Backend Processing:** The AI analysis is performed by a dedicated backend service (REQ-4.6.2), ensuring it has secure access to all necessary data and external AI models.

- **Data Storage (REQ-6):** The AI's output (the `AISummaryMemo`, including the recommendation) is stored as a dedicated entity linked to the `Deal` record in the database.

- **CRUD for AI Output:** While the AI generates the initial output, the system allows for the AI Summary Memo to be associated with the deal. The primary interaction is viewing and potentially regenerating (Update) the analysis. Deletion might be restricted for audit purposes (REQ-4.10.5, REQ-5.9), but the ability to view (Read) the AI's analysis is crucial (REQ-4.3.1).

- **Frontend Display:** The AI Summary Memo and its recommendation are prominently displayed on the Deal Detail Page (REQ-4.3.1) when the deal is in the 'AI Review' stage, fetched from the backend.

- **Notifications:** Users (especially Partners/IC) are notified when the AI analysis is complete (REQ-4.2.6).

- **Audit Trail:** The triggering and completion of the AI analysis are recorded in the audit trail (REQ-4.10.5).


In essence, the AI Analyst Module provides a powerful capability to synthesize diverse information about a deal and offer an objective perspective, acting as a valuable, data-driven voice in the final stages of the investment evaluation process.
