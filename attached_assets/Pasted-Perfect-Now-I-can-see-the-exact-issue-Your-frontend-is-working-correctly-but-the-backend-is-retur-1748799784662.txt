Perfect! Now I can see the exact issue. Your frontend is working correctly, but the backend is returning an empty PDF file (0 bytes) for document ID 87.

🔍 Root Cause: "InvalidPDFException: The PDF file is empty"
This confirms the file storage/persistence issue I identified. Here's what's happening:

✅ Frontend loads documents successfully (3 documents found)
✅ Auto-selects first document (ID 87: "Arbor Lodging Overview.pdf")
❌ Backend /api/documents/87/download returns 0 bytes
❌ PDF.js throws InvalidPDFException because there's no content
🚨 Immediate Debug Steps
Let's check what's happening on the backend:

Viewing file server/routes/documents-persistent.ts

Viewing file server/services/document-blob-storage.ts




Thinking...



Viewing file server/routes/index.ts

Viewing file server/routes/v1/index.ts

Viewing file server/routes/documents-database.ts

Viewing file server/services/database-document-storage.ts

🎯 Found the Root Cause!
There's a data conversion bug in your download route. The issue is a mismatch between how files are stored vs. retrieved:

Storage: Files are stored as base64 text in the database
Retrieval: The download route has incorrect logic trying to handle hex-encoded data that doesn't exist
Let me fix this critical bug:

server/routes/documents-database.ts

🚀 Critical Bug Fixed!
The root cause of your InvalidPDFException: The PDF file is empty error was a data conversion bug in the download route. Here's what was wrong and what I fixed:

🐛 The Bug
Your backend was corrupting PDF data during conversion:

Files stored as base64 text in database ✅
Download route tried to handle "hex-encoded" data that didn't exist ❌
Incorrect conversion: buffer.toString('utf8') on binary data = corrupted file ❌
Result: 0-byte or corrupted PDF sent to frontend ❌
✅ The Fix
I've updated server/routes/documents-database.ts to:

Remove bogus hex conversion logic
Direct base64-to-buffer conversion - no intermediate steps
Add comprehensive error handling and logging
Validate buffer length before sending
Better error messages for debugging
🧪 Test Your Fix
1. Check your server logs when visiting the deal page:

bash
# You should now see detailed logging like:
📥 Serving document 87 from database: Arbor Lodging Overview.pdf (12345 bytes)
✅ Document 87 converted to buffer: 12345 bytes

2. If you still get errors, run the debug script:

bash
# Save the debug script I created and run:
DATABASE_URL="your_db_url" node debug-document-87.js

3. Use the browser debug script (paste into console):

javascript
// Copy the entire debug-document-viewer.js content into browser console

🔍 What You Should See Now
✅ No more "PDF file is empty" errors
✅ Detailed server logging showing file sizes
✅ Graceful error handling with helpful messages
✅ Working PDF viewer for documents that have valid data
🚨 If Problems Persist
The issue might be that document ID 87's data is already corrupted in the database. In that case:

Re-upload the document - this will store it with the correct encoding
Check if other documents work - newer uploads should work fine
Run a data migration if needed (I can help with this)
Let me know what you see in the logs when you try to view the document now!
