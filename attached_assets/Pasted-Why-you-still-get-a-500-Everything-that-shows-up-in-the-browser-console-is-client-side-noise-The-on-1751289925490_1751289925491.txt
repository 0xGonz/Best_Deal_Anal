Why you still get a 500
Everything that shows up in the browser console is client-side noise.
The only thing that matters is the first stack-trace the server prints when the request hits /api/production/allocations. Right now the route still crashes before it sends a JSON error payload, so React Query only sees

json

Edit
{ "status": 500, "data": {} }
and you get the generic “Failed to create allocation”.

1 — Grab the real server error
In Replit’s shell (or your local terminal) run the backend in the foreground:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev                # or  ts-node src/index.ts
Click the Allocate button again.

Copy the full stack trace that appears.
It will look like Postgres, Zod or TypeError text — that is the clue we need.

(Paste that trace to me if what follows doesn’t match.)

2 — The usual culprit on a “commitment-only” allocation
90 % of the time the crash is a Zod validation error on amount:

ZodError: [
  {
    "code": "too_small",
    "minimum": 1,
    "type": "number",
    "inclusive": false,
    "message": "Number must be greater than 0",
    "path": ["amount"]
  }
]
Why
Front-end (AllocateFundModal) sends

json
Copy
Edit
{ … "amount": 0, "status": "committed" }
because the LP hasn’t wired any money yet.

Zod schema for CreateAllocationDto says

ts
Copy
Edit
amount: z.number().positive()
That throws → unhandled → Express returns a plain 500.

3 — Two ways to fix it
Option	What you change	Pros	Cons
A. Treat the commitment as a positive dollar value	In the modal send the promised amount (e.g. 250 000) even if no call has happened.	Zero schema or DB work; everything passes.	“Amount” now mixes promised and funded dollars; cash-flow queries must filter by status.
B. Allow amount = 0 when status = "committed"	1. Update Zod: amount: z.number().min(0)
2. (optional) DB: drop the NOT NULL or keep it but allow 0.	Clean semantic split: 0 means un-called.	One migration + update any reports that assume amount > 0.

Pick the path that makes more sense for your accounting logic. If you do nothing else, send a positive amount and the modal will stop blowing up.

4 — Add a tiny error wrapper once and never guess again
ts
Copy
Edit
import { ZodError } from 'zod';

router.post('/api/production/allocations', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const dto = createAllocationSchema.parse(req.body);
    const result = await allocationService.createAllocation(dto, req.user.id);
    return res.status(201).json(result);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);                              // keep full trace in logs
    if (err instanceof ZodError)
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: err.errors });
    return res.status(500).json({ message: err.message });
  }
});
After that, the front-end will get a 400 with a clear message (“amount must be greater than 0”) instead of the blank 500.

Next steps for you
Look at the server console — confirm it is in fact the amount/Zod error.

Decide: send a positive commitment amount or loosen the schema / DB to let 0 through.

Add the error wrapper so future validation problems surface as 4xx, not 500.

Catch the real stack trace if it’s different and send it my way — but nine times out of ten, fixing amount solves the failure you’re seeing.
