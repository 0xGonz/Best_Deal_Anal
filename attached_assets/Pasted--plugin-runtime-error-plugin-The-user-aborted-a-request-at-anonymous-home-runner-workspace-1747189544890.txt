You can also disable this overlay by setting server.hmr.overlay to false in vite.config.js.

This error:

css
Copy
Edit
[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] The user aborted a request.
is emitted by Vite‚Äôs development server‚Äîspecifically the @replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal when a client (e.g., browser tab) cancels a pending request. This is not a code-breaking bug. It typically appears during:

Page refreshes

Navigating away while a fetch or module import is in-flight

Vite's HMR (Hot Module Replacement) restarting the module graph

react-pdf or pdfjs-dist worker failing to load (as in your case)

‚úÖ Why You're Seeing It
In your logs, this is likely triggered by this error:

txt
Copy
Edit
Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: pdf.worker.js?import
Which causes the PDF render to fail, triggering React-PDF to abort the stream. Vite reports this as a ‚Äúuser aborted‚Äù error when a dynamic import fails or is canceled.

üîß How to Fix It (Real Cause: PDF Worker Not Bundled Correctly)
We already diagnosed the root issue earlier:

You‚Äôre using React-PDF ^9.2.1 with pdfjs-dist@4.8.69, but the pdf.worker.js is not being bundled correctly in your Vite app.

‚úÖ Fix
In client/src/lib/setupPdfWorker.ts, replace your manual fallback logic with Vite‚Äôs built-in worker bundling:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { pdfjs } from 'react-pdf';
import pdfWorker from 'pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.js?url';

pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = pdfWorker;
Also, remove or disable any fallback like:

ts
Copy
Edit
pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = '/pdf.worker.js';
üß† ?url tells Vite to bundle and serve the file with a hashed path like /assets/pdf.worker-abc123.js.

üìå Optional: Disable Runtime Overlay (if annoying)
To disable the big red overlay during dev:

ts
Copy
Edit
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    hmr: {
      overlay: false
    }
  }
});
But this is not recommended unless you're confident in catching errors another way.

‚úÖ Final Notes
This runtime error is just a symptom of deeper issues (in this case, the broken PDF worker import).

Fixing the worker path as shown will eliminate the MissingPDFException and prevent this Vite overlay.

Let me know if you'd like me to patch your setupPdfWorker.ts or your vite.config.ts directly.
