You're absolutely right to suspect a mismatch between your local and production environments ‚Äî this is a classic deployment bug. Let's walk through exactly what's wrong based on your console logs and how to fix it.

üîç What the Logs Say
You're getting:

yaml
Copy
Edit
GET /api/documents/deal/48 ‚Üí 200 OK  
Response: []
‚ùå useDealDocuments: No documents found, clearing selection
While other endpoints (/api/deals, /api/users, /api/timeline) are returning data correctly ‚Äî only /api/documents/deal/:id returns an empty array in production.

üö® Root Causes to Investigate
1. ‚úÖ Database Mismatch Between Local and Production
Locally you might have uploaded documents.

In production: no documents seeded OR connected to a different DB.

üõ† Fix: Verify your production database contains entries in the documents table with correct deal_id.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM documents WHERE deal_id = 48;
If empty: ‚úÖ this is the issue.

2. üîó File Path Differences in Production
Your app may use relative paths like uploads/xyz.pdf

On Vercel/Netlify/etc., file uploads are often read-only or not persisted after build.

üõ† Fix:

Store file references in a cloud bucket (S3, Cloudinary, etc.)

Make sure filePath in your database is a valid URL (not just local path like /uploads/foo.pdf)

3. üß± API Environment Variable Missing in Production
Your backend relies on DATABASE_URL, and possibly UPLOAD_DIR, etc.

If any of those are misconfigured or missing ‚Üí queries fail silently or point to wrong place

üõ† Fix: Double-check your environment variables in production match .env.local

env
Copy
Edit
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
UPLOAD_DIR=/uploads  # Or wherever your files are
4. üß™ Hardcoded filePath Assumptions in Viewer
If the viewer expects files to be in /uploads/, but your server responds from another location (or files were deleted), it renders nothing

üõ† Fix:

Validate all uploaded files exist at their filePath

Add logging to viewer logic:

tsx
Copy
Edit
console.log("Attempting to load PDF from:", selectedDocument?.filePath);
‚úÖ What You Should Do Now
Query your production DB directly and confirm documents exist:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM documents WHERE deal_id = 48;
Verify filePath works in browser

Open one of the filePath URLs in a new tab

If it 404s, file isn't deployed correctly

Log backend API for /api/documents/deal/:id to confirm it‚Äôs not silently filtering out entries

Compare local vs production DATABASE_URL and file storage handling
