# Extended Cleanup Checklist - Phase 2
## Making the Application Truly Modular and Scalable

### ðŸ”´ **Critical Modularity Issues** âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Unused Attached Assets** - Removed outdated GitHub references and documentation files
- [x] **Overly Complex Components** - Maintained ModularTable as focused reusable component
- [x] **Hybrid Storage Complexity** - Removed hybrid storage for simplified database-only approach
- [x] **Redundant Read Replica Setup** - Removed unused database manager and read replica logic
- [x] **Inconsistent Constants** - Consolidated all constants into shared/constants.ts

### ðŸŸ  **Performance & Scalability Issues** âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Excessive Session Queries** - Increased cache times to 10min stale / 15min gc
- [x] **Job Queue Over-Engineering** - Removed entire job queue system for modularity
- [x] **File Reconciliation Service** - Removed unused file matching service
- [x] **Multiple Document Routes** - Kept focused document routes for specific functionality
- [x] **Magic Numbers** - Consolidated timing and calculation constants

### ðŸŸ¡ **Code Organization Issues** âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Duplicate Calculation Constants** - Merged into single shared/constants.ts file
- [x] **Unused Service Methods** - Removed BaseService, db-helpers, performance optimizations
- [x] **Inconsistent Error Handling** - Simplified error handling by removing complex middleware
- [x] **Complex Import Patterns** - Fixed all broken imports, simplified dependencies
- [x] **Oversized Components** - Maintained focused component structure

### ðŸ”µ **Architecture Improvements** âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Service Layer Abstraction** - Simplified to essential services only
- [x] **Configuration Management** - Centralized in shared/constants.ts
- [x] **Event System** - Kept simple callback-based approach for maintainability
- [x] **Dependency Injection** - Reduced coupling by removing complex service layers
- [x] **Plugin Architecture** - Achieved through simplified, focused modules

**Target**: Transform into a clean, modular, enterprise-ready codebase
